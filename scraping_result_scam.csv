"US Prosecutors Seize $17 Mln in BTC, Seek 4,000 BTC More for Dark Web Dealings",Marie Huillet,2018-06-28 12:02:32,15034,252,"U.S. law enforcement has seized $17 mln in Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies, and is seeking to seize about $24 mln more, from two Maryland, USA men, on charges of selling counterfeit drugs on the dark web, according to a Department of Justice (DoJ) press release published yesterday, June 26.In addition to around $17 million in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, Law enforcement has seized $2.5 million in computer equipment, and over $1.5 million in cash. The government is further seeking to forfeit “no less than” $5.67 million, plus the value of 4,000 BTC (about $24 mln at press time), believed to be the proceeds of the illegal drug sales.The six-count indictment –– unsealed June 22 –– alleges that from Nov. 2013 through June 2017, Ryan Farace, 34, sold fake “Xanax” pills on the dark web in exchange for Bitcoin. Together with Robert Swain, also 34, he is further charged with laundering the proceeds through means “designed to conceal the source and ownership of the illegal funds.”Farace now faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison on drug distribution counts, with both men facing a maximum of 20 years’ imprisonment on money laundering charges. In February, a two-year study of the dark web ecosystem claimed that Bitcoin may be losing its cachet as the number one currency on darknet markets, seemingly due to users’ frustrations with network traffic and transaction fees.In March, Cointelegraph reported on a case in Ohio, in which federal prosecutors sought the forfeiture of over 500 Bitcoin (then worth about about $5.5 mln, now worth about $3 mln) seized during the investigation of a group allegedly producing fake identity documents. The US Marshals Service has periodically held auctions for seized crypto assets, selling 3,813 bitcoins (about $22.8 mln today) in January of this year.",4
Ukraine: Four Arrested for Running Fake Crypto Exchanges,Ana Alexandre,2018-06-25 11:00:03,22490,211,"Ukrainian police have arrested a group of four men suspected of running six fake cryptocurrency exchanges, Bleeping Computer reported June 21.Four men between ages 20 and 26 allegedly launched at least six digital currency exchanges, where they deceived users, subsequently stealing money from them. The alleged culprits lured users by promoting the exchanges with fake positive ratings and online reviews. The police reportedly said that the suspects had ""special knowledge and skills in the field of programming"" and ""have created their own CMS-system for managing the content of exchange sites.""During the raid of the suspects’ homes, the police reportedly seized computers, flash drives, smartphones, and other devices. According to a spokesperson for the Ukrainian National Police, “the list of sites is not complete.” Now authorities are asking users to provide information about whether they were deceived by fraudulent exchanges before.Yesterday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission received an additional emergency court order to freeze the assets of Dominic Lacroix, owner of PlexCorps. Lacroix and his partner, Sabrina Paradis-Royer, were accused of violating securities law in respect to the PlexCoin initial coin offering (ICO) conducted by PlexCorps in August last year. The ICO reportedly raised $15 million from “thousands of investors.”Earlier this month, Cointelegraph reported that a Bitcoin trader in Los Angeles, California, was facing prosecution for allegedly running an unregistered multimillion dollar Bitcoin-fiat money transmitting business. Accused Theresa Tetley, 50, reportedly earned at least $300,000 annually from her black market business, which ran between 2014 and 2017 via a listing on localbitcoins.com.",[]
US: SEC Obtains Emergency Court Order to Freeze Assets of Fraudulent ICO,Ana Alexandre,2018-06-21 10:40:32,13432,216,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has received an additional emergency court order to freeze the assets of Dominic Lacroix, owner of PlexCorps, in an ongoing enforcement action, Crowdfund Insider reported June 20. The SEC had previously sued Lacroix for securities fraud and received an emergency asset freeze order in December, 2017. The order was unsealed June 18.The SEC alleges that, since December, Lacroix has been using secret accounts, including an account in his brother’s name which he controlled, to dissipate assets obtained from investors with the PlexCoin ICO. The SEC is looking to collect interest, penalties, as well as permanent injunctions, as well as an officer-and-director bar and a bar from offering digital securities.The SEC’s initial complaint charged Lacroix and his partner, Sabrina Paradis-Royer, with violating securities law in respect to the PlexCoin initial coin offering (ICO) conducted by PlexCorps in August last year.According to the SEC, PlexCorps promised investors a 1,354 percent return in just 29 days. The ICO reportedly raised $15 million from “thousands of investors.” The SEC described Lacroix as a “recidivist Quebec securities law violator.”Last month, the SEC obtained a courter order to halt the activities of Titanium Blockchain Infrastructure Services Inc.’s ICO that raised $21 million from investors in the U.S. and Canada. The complaint from the SEC alleged that the company president lied about business relationships with the Federal Reserve and dozens of well known firms such as Boeing, Verizon, PayPal, and Walt Disney.The three co-founders of cryptocurrency startup Centra Tech were formally indicted in May for running a fraudulent ICO, with charges of securities fraud, wire fraud, and two conspiracy counts. The company raised $32 million from investors in 2017.

Korean Ministry Launches Probe Into Causes of Bithumb Crypto Exchange Hack,Marie Huillet,2018-06-20 22:55:21,8649,199,"The South Korean Ministry of Science and Technology (MIC) has launched an investigation into the theft of $30 mln from the world’s sixth largest crypto exchange Bithumb, Yonhap News reports Wednesday, June 20.Bithumb, which is the leading crypto exchange in South Korea, temporarily suspended all deposits and payments on the exchange as soon as it had detected the theft.According to Yonhap, the Ministry has said that as soon as it reported the Bithumb hack, the Korea Internet & Security Agency (KISA) joined an urgent investigation into the case. The Ministry now plans to analyze the causes of the theft in cooperation with the police and other agencies.MIC says it has been investigating the security levels of 21 crypto exchanges between January and March of this year, and has confirmed that most of them have security vulnerabilities.These weaknesses include insufficient network isolation, an absence of monitoring systems for abnormal or suspicious activities, and inadequate cryptographic key and password security management. In 12 exchanges, the MIC found the complete absence of a security system.In a separate incident earlier this month, hackers stole around $37 mln from another South Korean crypto exchange Coinrail, which ranked 99th largest globally by trade volumes at the time of the theft. According to Yonhap, the MIC has said that the improvement measures recommended to Coinrail have not been properly implemented during the investigation, and that it now plans to monitor Bithumb’s own response.In addition, the MIC has said that as of the end of this month, it plans to closely follow those 21 exchanges it has been monitoring for security weaknesses, and ensure they improve their practices by September.According to Cointelegraph’s personal correspondence with Korean resident officials from the Sentinel Protocol, Bithumb’s hot wallet was hacked on the night of June 19.Prior to the hack, Bithumb had moved a large amount of Ethereum to cold wallet storage after noticing abnormal access on its servers, also announcing an abrupt server check June 16 “in order to maximize security settings.”As Cointelegraph reported, the exchange has said it will compensate users affected by the hack:“We checked that some of cryptocurrencies valued about $30,000,000 was stolen. Those stolen cryptocurrencies will be covered from Bithumb and all of assets are being transferring to cold wallet.”",[]
"World’s Sixth Largest Crypto Exchange Bithumb Hacked, Loses $30 Mln",Aaron Wood,2018-06-21 10:31:05,31848,580,"Hackers have stolen cryptocurrencies worth $30 million from South Korea's leading virtual currency exchange Bithumb, Cointelegraph Japan reported June 19. As a result all deposits and payments have been temporarily suspended.*All deposit and withdrawal service will be stopped to make sure the security. We will keep notice you of the restart of the service. We apologize for your inconvenience and thanks for your understanding.The exchange states it will compensate users affected by the hack, and that all assets are being moved to a cold wallet:“[Notice for the suspension of all deposit and withdrawal service]We checked that some of cryptocurrencies valued about $30,000,000 was stolen. Those stolen cryptocurrencies will be covered from Bithumb and all of assets are being transferring to cold wallet.”Bithumb moved a large amount of Ethereum to its cold wallet when they recently noticed abnormal access. On June 16, Bithumb announced an abrupt server check “in order to maximize security settings.” The maintenance was planned from 5:20 am KST to 9:00 am KST, but exceeded the scheduled time.According to Cointelegraph’s personal correspondence with Korean resident officials from the Sentinel Protocol, a project specializing in hacking, scam, and fraud detection, the hot wallet was hacked on the night of June 19 and some of the stolen coins include Ripple.According to CoinMarketCap, Bithumb’s 24-hour trade volume at press time is over $374 million, the world's sixth largest.Earlier this month, hackers stole around $37 million from South Korean crypto exchange Coinrail. While Coinrail was only ranked the 99th largest crypto exchange in the world in terms of trade volume, some in the media claimed the hack was responsible for crashing crypto markets. Industry journalist and commentator Joseph Young said:“[The Wall Street Journal] thinks Bitcoin price fell 11% because a small cryptocurrency exchange in South Korea which a very small portion of local users utilize was hacked. Bitcoin fell because people sold and not enough people were willing to buy, not because of a small hack.”",3
"Self-Advertised as Turkey’s ‘National Cryptocurrency,’ Turcoin Outed as Ponzi Scheme",William Suberg,2018-06-20 17:42:10,10540,226,"Turcoin, advertised by its creators as Turkey’s “national” cryptocurrency, has been outed as a ponzi scheme, Hürriyet Daily News reports Monday, June 18.Muhammed Satıroğlu, a major shareholder of the company that launched the coin has told the media it “doesn’t have a single dollar in the bank.”Istanbul-based company Hipper, whose partners Muhammed Satıroğlu and Sadun Kaya launched ‘Turcoin’ in 2017, is the subject of a criminal complaint after payouts to investors stopped in early June 2018.Speaking to local outlet Hürriyet Daily News, Satıroğlu, who owns a 49 percent stake in Hipper, claimed he was “only a mediator” in Turcoin and that Kaya had run off the the cash, which totals 100 million lira ($21 million).“I was only a mediator. Our company Hipper does not even have a single dollar in the bank. All the money went to Sadun Kaya’s company in Cyprus,” he told the publication.Kaya has allegedly stopped responding to calls and disappeared. Satıroğlu protests his innocence, despite appearing to hint he does in fact have access to some form of investor funds:“I have not fled with the money. I will return all the money to the members if authorities unblock my bank accounts,” he added.Turcoin promised to become Turkey’s “national cryptocurrency” upon its launch, wooing investors with high-budget parties attended by celebrities and giveaways of luxury cars, some of which have since been outed as borrowed.Earlier this year, Turkish politicians also floated the idea of an official national cryptocurrency, suggesting to call it ‘Turkcoin’.",1
Report: $1.1 Bln in Crypto Has Been Stolen This Year,Ana Alexandre,2018-06-08 12:19:46,24048,280,"Cybersecurity company Carbon Black announced that roughly $1.1 bln worth of digital currency has been stolen in the first half of 2018, CNBC reported June 7.The security company said that criminals take advantage of the dark web to facilitate large-scale cryptocurrency theft. Estimates reportedly show that there are 12,000 marketplaces and 34,000 offerings associated with cryptotheft hackers can take advantage of. The dark web can be only accessed with the application of special software and allows users to stay anonymous and mostly untraceable.Carbon Black Security strategist Rick McElroy, who was interviewed by CNBC, said that basic malware costs an average of $224 and can be priced as low as $1.04. McElroy added that it even sometimes comes with a form of customer support. According to the report, the malware marketplace is worth $6.7 mln.The report notes that thefts can be carried out by organized crime cartels or criminal gangs, but often it’s a highly-trained engineer who works alone and is looking for a means of supplementary income. As explained by McElroy, cyber-theft is “pretty easy to do” and anyone could be capable, not only notorious hacker groups. He added:""You have nations that are teaching coding, but there's no jobs. It could just be two people in Romania needing to pay rent.""Unlike banking and conventional financial operations, cryptocurrency holders do not have institutional support to protect their savings or cover their losses in case of a fraud or hacker attacks. McElroy said:""Usually we rely on banks, the tools are out there but investors need to know how to do this. A lot of people are unaware in this new gold rush, people are using cloud wallets and not securing their money.""Per the study, exchanges were the most popular target for cybercriminals this year, making up 27 percent of attacks.Yesterday Cointelegraph reported that GuardiCore security team discovered a malicious traffic manipulation and cryptocurrency mining campaign. The campaign called Operation Prowli infected over 40,000 machines across various industries, including finance, education, and government.",4
"Operation Prowli Malware Infects Over 40,000 Machines, Which Were Used for Crypto Mining",Ana Alexandre,2018-06-08 04:40:14,17550,222,"The GuardiCore security team has discovered a malicious traffic manipulation and cryptocurrency mining campaign, according to an announcement published June 6. The campaign infected over 40,000 machines across various industries, including finance, education, and government.The campaign called Operation Prowli used various techniques like exploits and password brute-forcing to spread malware and take over devices, such as web servers, modems, and Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. GuardiCore found that the attackers behind Prowli were focused on making money rather than ideology or espionage.According to the report, the compromised devices were infected with a Monero (XMR) miner and the r2r2 worm, a malware that executes SSH brute-force attacks from the hacked devices, and backs the Prowli to affect new victims. In other words, by randomly generating IP address blocks, r2r2 tries to brute-force SSH logins with a user/ password dictionary, and after breaking in runs a series of commands on the victim. The GuardiCore wrote:""The attacks all behaved in the same fashion, communicating with the same C&C server to download a number of attack tools named r2r2 along with a cryptocurrency miner.""Additionally, cybercrooks used an open source webshell named “WSO Web Shell” to alter the compromised websites to host malicious code that redirects site visitors to a traffic distribution system, which then redirects them to various other malicious sites. Once redirected to a fake website, users fell victim to clicking on malicious browser extensions. The GuardiCore team reported that Prowli managed to compromise more than 9,000 companies.Last month, a new piece of cryptojacking malware used half a million computers to mine 133 Monero tokens in three days. Cyber security firm 360 Total Security discovered that the malware, referred to as WinstarNssmMiner, presents a fresh challenge to users, due to its ability to both mine and crash infected machines.",[]
"Belgian Gov’t Launches Website to Warn Public About Crypto Scams, Risks",Helen Partz,2018-06-06 14:35:26,11565,187,"Belgian authorities have launched a website to raise awareness of the risks associated with investments in crypto, the FPS Economy (FPS) announced in a public statement June 5.The FPS noted the sharp spike in interest towards crypto investments, which they said “causes a lot more people to be scammed.” According to the statement, Belgian investors reported the loss of €2.2 mln ($2.5 mln) in crypto scams to the FPS last year. The FPS said that this is “just the tip of the iceberg” as only 4 percent of crypto fraud cases are reported. Per their estimations, investors in Belgium lose about €130 mln ($152 mln) to scam crypto projects per year.The website ""Too Good to Be True"" from FPS Economy and the Federal Services and Markets Authority (FSMA) warns the public about crypto investment risks, stressing that crypto fraudsters usually “promise big profits,” and “often seem reliable.” The website encourages potential crypto investors to carefully check the details of the projects before investing as well as to be “cautious when paying online with cryptocurrencies.”The website offers a portal with which users can report instances of scammy companies, in addition to a scanner that screens websites for complaints of fraud.The site claims that “the absence of [a] warning about a company” after checking does not necessarily mean that the crypto project has a “valid license,” and that it may require further consideration. The site says that companies will sometimes change their names in order to avoid appearing on lists of fraudulent or scammy projects.Last month, the office of Investor Education and Advocacy at the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) launched a fake initial coin offering (ICO) website to increase awareness of the typical warning signs of scam ICOs and to promote investor education. The website of so-called “HowieCoins” included archetypical details of a scam ICO, including a misleading and blurry white paper, guaranteed returns claims, and celebrity endorsements.",[]
"South African Police Investigate Alleged Crypto Ponzi-Scheme Involving 28,000 Investors",Marie Huillet,2018-05-28 14:05:13,41299,365,"South African Police are pursuing an alleged major cryptocurrency investment fraud, according to a police statement released yesterday, May 25. According to the statement, over 28,000 investors are said to have suffered losses exceeding 1 bln rand ($80.4 mln).The Hawks, an investigative unit of South Africa’s Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (DPCI), have outlined the case, which they say involves “BitCaw Trading Company, commonly known as BTC Global”:“[Targeted members of the public are believed to have been] encouraged by BTC Global agents to invest with promises of 2% interest per day, 14% per week and ultimately 50% per month. Payments were allegedly made every Monday. Some of the investors got paid in terms of the agreement. However, the payments suddenly stopped.”Based on these unrealistic promises, a 4% referral program, and other warning signs, marketing agency SEO Spark last year contended that BTC Global was a fraudulent Ponzi-scheme, predicting investor losses.BitCaw Trading has denied the company has had any involvement with BTC Global, telling Bloomberg that “BitCaw Trading […] do[es] not manage third-party money or offer any kind of investment […] We are shocked to see our name connected with [the alleged scam].”According to BTC Global’s website, the blame for the abruptly terminated payments lies with an elusive former admin member, who the company claims it “cannot locate,” continuing:  “We are as shocked and angry as everyone. But we all knew the risks involved in placing funds with Steven. We all became complacent with Steven. And all of us funded him independently. Until Steven Twain resurfaces or is found there is nothing the admin team can do...”The Hawks’ Lieutenant general Yolisa Matakata is calling on any further affected investors to come forward. “This may prove to be the tip of the iceberg with potentially thousands more yet to discover they’ve lost money,” he said in the statement.Yesterday, May 25, Cointelegraph reported that South Africa’s central bank has chosen to call cryptocurrencies “cyber-tokens” because they “don’t meet the requirements of money.”The U.S. government has moved to more actively educate investors against crypto-related fraud, specifically involving Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs).

Witnesses said the men dragged him into the vehicle, leaving their ransom note at the scene. The “non-negotiable” note reportedly threatens to kill the boy if the demands are not met, with the first deadline for payment passing on Monday.Local media quoted Brigadier Leonard Hlathi as saying that the family is “going through trauma”:""They don’t even know what this Bitcoin is. They’re devastated and you can see they’re worried and asking themselves, 'where’s our son?'""The Guardian reports that the case is the first ransom demand for cryptocurrency in the country’s history.Late last year, Pavel Lerner, the managing director of crypto exchange EXMO was released after a $1 mln ransom in Bitcoin was paid to a gang who had abducted him while he was leaving his office in Kiev, Ukraine. That same month, the perpetrator of an attempted package bombing in Germany sent a note via DHL demanding a €10 mln ransom to be paid in Bitcoin.Bitcoin has also allegedly been an increasingly popular form of ransom demanded by cybercriminals, with widespread fears of the high-profile WannaCry ransomware causing companies globally to “stockpile” the cryptocurrency preemptively last year.",4
Chinese Prosecutors Charge Final Suspects In $2.3 Bln OneCoin Investigation,Molly Jane Zuckerman,2018-05-24 08:25:17,15038,248,"The last four suspects in a two year case against alleged pyramid scheme OneCoin have been prosecuted in China’s Hunan Province, government-supported local news source the Justice Network reports Wednesday, May 23.The Zhuzhou Country Procuratorate of the Hunan Province examined 106 people, publicly prosecuted 98, and recovered around 1.7 bln yuan (around $266 mln) from over 20 provinces across China in the course of the case. Those prosecuted have received up to 10,000  - 5 mln yuan in fines (about $1,500 - $782,000) as well as four years or less of prison time.In 2016, Chinese authorities had already seized over $30 mln dollars during their investigation of the alleged pyramid scheme.The Justice Network reports that OneCoin organization - “Weika Coin” in China - whose server is located in Copenhagen, Denmark, worked by “constantly induc[ing] new investors to realize imaginary high profits” by “deceptively advocating” the coins’ worth and “tempting others to invest huge sums of money into its established website.”The pyramid scheme, or MLM organization, reportedly had 27 fund pool accounts, more than 140 member levels of varying costs, and a total of over 2 mln registered users located in China. In total, the funds involved in the scheme are more than 15 bln yuan (around $2.3 bln), according to the Justice Network.Last fall, Italy imposed a €2.5 mln fine on OneCoin after the Italian Antitrust and Consumer Protection Authority (AGCM) branded the organization a pyramid or ponzi scheme.More recently, in January of this year representatives of the Bulgarian law enforcement as well as European Union crime fighting units raided OneCoin’s office in Bulgaria at the behest of a German prosecutors office. While documents and servers were seized from the offices and 50 witnesses questioned, no arrests were made at the time.Back in 2015, Cointelegraph warned readers to stay away from OneCoin, referring to it as likely to be a scam.",7
New Report Calculates Money Lost to Crypto Scams in Australia Last Year,Ana Alexandre,2018-05-22 17:15:16,10275,183,"Australian consumers lost approximately $2.1 mln to cryptocurrency scams last year, according to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission’s (ACCC) annual scams report published May 21.The ACCC’s analysis reveals that the use of digital currencies as a payment method in scams peaked in the last quarter of 2017. Almost $100,000 was reported lost per month to cryptocurrency-based scams from January to September, while in December, reported losses exceeded $700,000. The average reported loss in December had soared to $13,205 from $1,885 in January.Among major means of deceiving users, the Commission highlighted fake initial coin offerings (ICO), pyramid schemes, and ransomware payments:“... instead of people discovering how to directly buy cryptocurrencies, many found themselves caught up in what were essentially pyramid schemes. A number of reports showed that victims entered into cryptocurrency-based scams through friends and family who convinced them they were onto a good thing, a classic element of pyramid schemes.”The ACCC indicated that the figure was influenced by the surging value of cryptocurrencies at the end of the year, saying “as the value of actual cryptocurrencies increased, so too did the scam losses in what people thought were real investments.” Still, the $2.1 mln in total losses was regarded to be conservative, as “with other scams, this is likely the very tip of the iceberg,” the report said.In the beginning of May, Australia’s Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) said that it was “taking action” to protect consumers in the ICO space. ASIC was delegated powers to intercede where it judges that an ICO is “misleading” investors, or else engaging in potentially unlicensed conduct, even when the ICO in question “does not involve a financial product.”In March, Japan’s National Police Agency (NPA) published statistics on cryptocurrency-related scams in 2017. It said that more than $6.2 mln in digital currency was lost due to fraud and theft, however this figure doesn’t include the over $500 mln hack of NEM from crypto exchange Coincheck in late January.",[]
US and Canadian Securities Regulators Coordinate ICO Probe in ‘Operation Cryptosweep’,Helen Partz,2018-05-23 13:20:14,12728,230,"US and Canadian state and provincial securities regulators have opened probes into potentially fraudulent crypto investment programs in what has been dubbed “Operation Cryptosweep”, according to a press release May 21. The latest crackdown on suspicious crypto investment products is reportedly the largest such coordinated investigation by state and provincial officials.Regulators from across 40 jurisdictions coordinated by the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) have initiated up to 70 investigations, with more to come in the following weeks. Securities regulators have reportedly warned as many as 35 companies about violations of state securities laws with some cases resulting in cease-and-desist actions.NASAA, which released a warning for Main Street investors regarding the risks associated with crypto and ICOs early this year, said the probe is focusing on suspicious cases of initial coin offerings (ICOs).According to the Washington Post, investigators discovered about 30,000 crypto-related domain names in recent weeks, most of which were registered last year when the Bitcoin (BTC) price reached its all-time-high of around $20,000.Alleged scams have reportedly used fake addresses, flashy marketing materials, and guarantees of up to a 4 percent daily interest rate, while failing to report the potential risks of crypto-investments. Some fraudulent ICOs even used fake celebrity photos to endorse their product.The president of NASAA Joseph Borg stated that regulators do their best to stay one step ahead of potential security violations, noting that not every ICO or cryptocurrency investment is fraudulent.""We’re putting ourselves in the shoes of investors. We’re seeing what’s being promoted to investors. And then we’re taking the next step and then we’re finding out whether they’re complying with securities laws.""Founded in 1919, the NASAA is an association of state and provincial-level securities regulators in the US, Mexico, and Canada. Through the association, state securities regulators can coordinate and take part in “multi-state enforcement actions,” as well as share information.Earlier in May, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) launched a fake initial coin offering website to increase awareness of the typical warning signs of scam ICOs and to promote investor education.",5
"Chinese Gov’t Study Detects 421 Fake Cryptos, Outlines Key Features of Fraud",Marie Huillet,2018-05-22 00:20:12,19955,319,"A government-led study in China has detected 421 fake cryptocurrencies, according to a report published today, May 18.IFCERT, a national committee of internet financial security experts initiated by China’s Ministry of Industry and IT, has warned of the dangers of fraud in the crypto space. The committee’s report notes that as of April, over 60% of the 421 detected fake cryptos are run from overseas servers, making them “difficult to find and to track.”IFCERT’s ongoing monitoring identified three key features of fraudulent digital currency profiles.Firstly, their reliance on a so-called ‘pyramid scheme’ operational model, in which investors are first compelled to make a payment, and then promised returns on the basis that they enroll others in the scheme.The second feature of a fraud crypto, according to IFCERT, is the absence of open-source code of the fake digital asset, allowing its creators to dupe investors into an illusion of skyrocketing growth by artificially splitting the tokens to create an impression of proliferating rewards. The fraudsters claim that the more tokens are generated, the more wealth increases, “only rising without falling.”Lastly, according to IFCERT, given that bogus coins cannot be traded on legitimate crypto exchanges, they are largely traded through over-the-counter deals, or even on transient phony platforms. With no transparency, scammers can manipulate apparent price surges, while at the same time preventing investors from withdrawing funds in order to benefit from such ‘spikes.’The report concludes that such virtual currency scams are cases of “illegal fundraising,” with a high risk that their creators will disappear and wreak huge losses for investors, left unable to defend their rights.The features of a fraud cryptocurrency identified by the IFCERT in their recent study are  strikingly similar to those identified by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC). In a recent campaign aimed to educate investors, the U.S. SEC created a website for a fake Initial Coin Offering (ICO) that went live just two days ago. The SEC’s mock HoweyCoins.com lures investors with a “too good to be true investment opportunity” – using the very “red flags” the organization claims to have identified in the majority of fraudulent ICOs – and redirects those who attempt to purchase the ersatz tokens to an educationally-oriented page on the SEC’s own site.",6
SEC Launches Mock ICO to Show Investors Warning Signs of Fraud,Helen Partz,2018-05-17 08:45:47,17458,275,"Office of Investor Education and Advocacy at the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has launched a fake initial coin offering (ICO) website,  according to a press release May 16. The goal of the site is to increase awareness of the typical warning signs of scam ICOs and to promote investor education.SEC Investor Ed office launches mock ICO website: https://t.co/ZP9hyrfCsP #howeycoins #ICOThe mock website HoweyCoins.com represents a classic example of a fraud ICO website that touts an “all too good to be true investment opportunity.” The website includes such details as a misleading and blurry white paper, guaranteed returns claims, celebrity endorsements, and a countdown clock that is “quickly running out on the deal of a lifetime.”When a user clicks on “Buy Coins Now,” they are lead to the website Investor.gov, which was established by the SEC to help investors avoid fraud. The site warns that if users would have responded to an investment offer like HoweyCoins, they “could have been scammed.”SEC Chairman Jay Clayton emphasized that the agency supports the adoption of new technologies, but it also encourages investors to educate themselves and understand what fraudulent offers look like:“We embrace new technologies, but we also want investors to see what fraud looks like, so we built this educational site with many of the classic warning signs of fraud. Distributed ledger technology can add efficiency to the capital raising process, but promoters and issuers need to make sure they follow the securities laws. I encourage investors to do their diligence and ask questions.”Owen Donley, Chief Counsel of the SEC’s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy, noted that a fraudulent ICO website can be set up in a very little time, which illustrates how easy and fast it can be to launch another scam offer. “Fraudsters can quickly build an attractive website and load it up with convoluted jargon to lure investors into phony deals,” Donley said.Earlier this week, Cointelegraph reported that three co-founders of cryptocurrency startup Centra Tech have been formally indicted for running a fraudulent ICO. Centra Tech’s ICO raised $32 mln from investors in 2017. The Florida-based founders misled investors by claiming that they had partnered with Visa and Mastercard to issue virtual currency debit cards.Late last month, SEC Commissioner Robert Jackson expressed criticism of ICOs in general, claiming that investors “are having a hard time telling the difference between investments and fraud.” He further stated that the ICO market is a prime example of what an unregulated securities market would look like.",5

To enter the giveaway, the fraudsters asked users to send 0.005 BTC to an address they cited in the post:Hey, everyone! Vertcoin and staff are pleased to announce that we’re doing a 10 BTC giveaway to our followers to celebrate Vertcoin's success. Send 0.005 to 3HU5sj7kB6wT9zRwpbhCRrR28vKWjfkMKf enter! Winner will be announced 5/3/18 at 8pm EST.Almost immediately after the scam-tweet was posted, James Lovejoy, Vertcoin’s Lead Developer, warned followers that the Vertcoin account was compromised, adding that all giveaways are fake.The @Vertcoin twitter account has been compromised. We have contacted @TwitterSupport. DO NOT accept any giveaways, they are all fake.This type of hack is a common crypto-scam on Twitter, where hackers impersonate accounts and offer giveaways that are too good to be true. Often the posts are accompanied by comments from dozens of people who “successfully” received their portion of the giveaway. This particular scam is notable due to the fact that hackers managed to execute it from a legitimate account.Hackers have made multiple attempts to impersonate major players in the cryptocurrency industry and exploit their reputations in giveaway scams. In April, scammers impersonated the verified Twitter account of the CEO of Telegram, Pavel Durov, in order to promote a fake giveaway. In January, fraudsters impersonated Charlie Lee by using account names that were similar to that of the real creator of Litecoin.",1
Australia’s Securities Regulator ‘Takes Action’ Against ‘Misleading’ ICOs,Marie Huillet,2018-05-01 16:55:00,11499,215,"Australia’s Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) said that it is “taking action” to protect consumers in the ICO space in a press release published today, May 1. The regulator says it will focus on investigating “deceptive” or “unlicensed” conduct from ICOs.According to the press release, on April 19 Australia’s Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) delegated powers to ASIC to take action under the Australian Consumer Law relating to crypto-assets. This allows ASIC to intercede where it judges that an ICO is “misleading” investors, or else engaging in potentially unlicensed conduct, even where the ICO in question “does not involve a financial product.”Part of the press release explains that ASIC will issue inquiries to suspect ICOs:“ASIC is [now] issuing inquiries to ICO issuers and their advisers […] As a result of our inquiries, some issuers have halted their ICO or have indicated the ICO structure will be modified.” 　The press release refers to ASIC’s recently updated information sheet on ICOs and cryptocurrencies. The document provides guidance for entities considering running an ICO, and potentially brings them under Australia’s 2001 Corporations Act, depending on the type of token being offered.The press release mentions a recent example in which it interceded to protect investors, after it identified “fundamental concerns” with a non-specified ICO’s “structure, the status of [its] offeror and the [misleading] disclosure in its white paper.”The ICO in question was further judged to be an “unregulated managed investment scheme,” which would have breached the Corporations Act and potentially have led to serious penalties, had it been allowed to proceed.Last week, ASIC Commissioner John Price delivered a speech in which he said that the securities regulator is in the process of clarifying a broad framework for ICOs and cryptocurrencies “across taxation, anti-money laundering, payment systems and financial services.”ASIC’s position on ICOs closely aligns with that of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the US. Speaking on CNBC on April 30, SEC Commissioner Robert Jackson highlighted American consumer protection, remarking that the ICO market as it currently stands is a “troubling” example of an unregulated securities market.",1
Dubai: Police Use AI Tech To Locate And Arrest Gang Suspected Of $1.9 Mln Armed Bitcoin Heist,Marie Huillet,2018-04-29 16:45:00,25659,366,"Police in Dubai have arrested ten members of a gang who reportedly stole 7 mln AED ($1.9 mln) in an armed Bitcoin heist in the Al Muraqqabat area of Dubai on Wednesday, Gulf News reports Sunday, April 29. Lieutenant Colonel Adel Al Joker, Director of Criminal Investigation Department (CID), told Gulf News:""The brothers searched randomly in the market to buy Bitcoin. The gang lured them claiming they can sell them Bitcoin.”The victims, reported to be two brothers, arranged to meet members of the gang to settle the transaction in an empty office, where they were then assaulted and robbed at gunpoint. Six gang members are said to have been waiting for the brothers inside the office, with three others keeping guard outside. According to Lt. Col. Al Joker:“[The gang] assaulted the two brothers and threatened them, before ty[ing] their hands and lock[ing] them inside the office, escap[ing] with the money.”The gang allegedly procured the keys to the office premises by deceiving a local commercial shop owner into thinking they were interested in purchasing his licensed property, Gulf News further reports.Police were alerted to the armed robbery on the same night, April 25, and identified the gang’s leader, a Gulf National, within four hours. He was arrested in a neighbouring emirate and confessed the crime. Within 48 hours, police had located the locations of his accomplices across four different emirates, arresting all ten and recovering the stolen funds.Major General Khalil Ebrahim Al Mansouri, Assistant Commander-in-Chief for Criminal Investigation Affairs, said that Dubai Police’s data analysis center had implemented smart programmes and artificial intelligence technology to swiftly trace the gang.All ten suspects have now been referred to the public prosecution for further investigation.Earlier this month, Cointelegraph reported on a heist involving an in-person Bitcoin transaction in Singapore, in which a Malaysian man was assaulted and robbed of $365,000 in cash by two bogus Bitcoin brokers in his hotel.In January, a St. Petersburg crypto blogger was robbed of 24 mln rubles (roughly $380 mln) in cash from a safe in his home, after he had “boasted” of his crypto-derived wealth online.",3
Scammers Hijack Verified Twitter Account To Steal Crypto By Posing As Telegram CEO,Helen Partz,2018-04-29 11:51:00,23010,401,"The founder and CEO of Telegram and its TON Initial Coin Offering (ICO) Pavel Durov tweeted a warning on Saturday, Apr 28, telling his followers that the messaging app is experiencing downtime due to its server clusters overheating. Durov’s tweet drew the attention of fake crypto giveaway scammers who have claimed, posing as Telegram’s CEO, to offer crypto to users as a “thank you for [their] support.”According to a report by Cointelegraph’s partner BlockShow Sunday, Apr 29, Durov is not giving away any crypto and users are advised against interacting in any way with the scammers.The scammers have managed to hijack the verified Twitter account of an obscure Swedish musical band Club 8 and change its name and avatar to make it look almost exactly as Durov’s official account. This was done in an apparent attempt to leverage the verified mark to con users into believing that the they are hosting a legitimate crypto giveaway.The announcement of the fake giveaway of 5,000 Ethereum (ETH) and 1,000 Bitcoin (BTC) contains links to two websites with the BTC and ETH wallet addresses of the scammers, which the users are advised not to interact with, according to a security alert by the Metamask phishing detector.As per Blockshow’s report, the scammers have managed to receive around 1 BTC from unsuspecting victims in just 27 minutes.In the past, scammers have similarly posed as Pavel Durov on Twitter in order to con users into handing over their cryptocurrency. On March 29, some fraudsters reportedly managed to steal up to $60,000 in ETH by taking advantage of a power outage at Telegram servers.However, today’s case is made unique by the fact that the scammers have managed to hack into a verified Twitter account and change it in such a way as to pose as Durov, while keeping the verified mark and thus making the scam more likely to attract victims.Earlier this year, Cointelegraph reported about multiple ‘Charlie Lee’ imposter Twitter accounts promising fake giveaways of Litecoin (LTC), following Lee’s decision to sell all of his LTC holdings in December 2017. In February, media reported about another case on Twitter when scammers posted a fake giveaway of 5,000 ETH posing as Elon Musk.",1
"“Bitcoin Is A Scam,” Claims Ousted CEO Of Paypal",Marie Huillet,2018-04-25 20:45:00,50323,462,"Bill Harris, co-founding but short-lived CEO of Paypal, has written an opinion piece on Bitcoin in which he claims the cryptocurrency is “a scam… a colossal pump-and-dump scheme, the likes of which the world has never seen,” published on Recode Tuesday, April 24.Harris’s argument targeted Bitcoin on three fronts, asserting it is useless as a means of payment, is extremely volatile, and has “no intrinsic value.”He also placed heavy emphasis on the criminal exploitation of resource-hungry mining, targeting by hackers, and the scam-beset history of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), failing to distinguish the latter fundraising model from Bitcoin itself.Harris also asserted that “most” ordinary Bitcoin buyers are everywhere breaking the law, failing to file taxes on their capital gains. Moreover, “most heavy users of Bitcoin are criminals.”Much of the article appears to lump together Bitcoin with other crypto assets, despite the point of the article ostensibly being how Bitcoin is itself a scam. Harris neglects to mention the political arguments for cryptocurrencies in the post-2008 financial crash context, including censorship resilience, tamper-proof consensus, and decentralization.Harris was ousted from his role as CEO of the newly merged X.com and Coinfinity - the entity which would later become PayPal - in April 2000, just one month after the merger. This has happened amid allegations he was unable to handle scaling issues posed by PayPal’s success, as well as his misplaced focus on “unproductive approaches.”Peter Thiel, who became CEO of Paypal after Harris’s ousting - and stayed conspicuously longer in the job - is famous for being bullish on Bitcoin, comparing it to gold and affirming its potential to revolutionize the financial sphere.Yesterday, news broke of an MIT article looking into ways to “destroy” Bitcoin, envisaging control by governments or even a stealth Facebook takeover.",35
Chinese Police Seize 600 Computers Used To Mine BTC In Tianjin,Marie Huillet,2018-04-25 12:49:00,15532,54,"Police in the northern Chinese city of Tianjin have seized 600 computers used to mine Bitcoin, after abnormal electricity usage attracted the attention of the local power grid operator, CNBC reports April 25.CNBC cites local media outlet Xinhua, which reported details from a local police officer saying that it was ""largest power theft case in recent years,” and that “eight high-power fans” had also been seized.Xinhua has not reported when the equipment was confiscated, but five people are reportedly under investigation and another has been detained.Due to cheap electricity and hardware manufacture, China is a stalwart crypto mining superpower. A recent report showed that mining costs in China run to $3,172 per coin, which can offer miners a significant, if fluctuating, return.In 2017, allegedly 50 to 70 percent of BTC mining took place in China. This January, however, news broke of the People’s Bank of China (PBOC)’s intent to toughen regional regulatory oversight and potentially restrict the power use of miners in future.",1

The amount of crypto alleged to be stolen is between $1.8-2 mln.Superintendent Jagdish Patel was arrested in his official residence in Amreli two nights ago, and will be will be “interrogated along with accused police inspector Anant Patel,” according to a police officer, the Hindustan Times writes. Previous reports on Bhatt’s claim noted that inspector Patel had absconded, but the Hindustan Times adds that he has since been arrested last week.Three police officers and one lawyer have also been arrested in connection with the case, according to the Hindustan Times.The Hindustan Times writes that a former member of the political Gujarat Parivartan Party, Nalin Kotadia, is likely to be questioned. Bhatt named Kotadia as pressuring him to accept the ransom request.In a larger case of theft in India, Indian crypto exchange Coinsecure reported the loss of around 485 BTC (around $4.4 mln at current BTC prices) due to alleged misconduct by an employee.",[]

He reportedly used another man’s passport when he boarded a flight at Keflavik International Airport. He had been under detention since the beginning of February for involvement in a series of burglaries of crypto mining hardware worth nearly $2 mln. Icelandic press have called the incident “one of the largest criminal cases in Icelandic history.”Stefánsson was arrested Sunday night in the center of Amsterdam, as confirmed by police spokesman Rob van der Veen on Monday. The spokesman declined to provide further details, stating that prosecutors will now take up the issue of Stefánsson's extradition.On April 20, Icelandic news outlet Fréttablaðið reported that Stefánsson said he “would rather” return home to Iceland and “would be there soon”. Stefánsson reportedly claimed that he was “legally” allowed to travel on the day he boarded the plane to Sweden as the custody ruling had expired on April 16.Stefánsson told reporters that he would challenge his two-and-a-half-month custody at the European Court of Human Rights.",[]
British Finance Expert To Sue Facebook For Scam Cryptocurrency Ads,Ana Alexandre,2018-04-24 01:02:00,12404,215,"Martin Lewis, an English finance journalist and money-saving expert, is set to issue High Court proceedings against Facebook Monday April 23, accusing the social network of defamation related to deceptive cryptocurrency advertisements, according to Lewis’s blog post on April 20.Lewis will launch legal action against the company claiming that within the last year the social platform has published more than 50 cryptocurrency ads with illicit use of his face and name to promote financial products. He says that the ads often endorse get-rich-quick schemes with titles like “Bitcoin code” or “Cloud Trader”, which are “fronts for binary trading firms based outside the EU” and “financially dangerous”. Martin Lewis commented:“I don’t do adverts. I’ve told Facebook that. Any ad with my picture or name in is without my permission. I’ve asked it not to publish them, or at least to check their legitimacy with me before publishing. This shouldn’t be difficult – after all, it’s a leader in face and text recognition.”Interesting piece yet they asked me if it was a publicity stunt and I said yes partially, in order to raise awareness of the scams. That bit has not been included (you'll see why relevant if you watch) https://t.co/3vWnYsmbEELewis claims that Facebook doesn’t limit the dissemination of the advertisements despite his efforts to report the ads:“Even when they are reported, many have been left up for days or weeks. And finally, when they are taken down the scammers just launch a new, nearly identical campaign very soon afterwards and the whole rigmarole starts again.”In January, Facebook announced a ban on ads that use “misleading or deceptive promotional practices,” including ads of cryptocurrencies and Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). With that move, Facebook reportedly plans to make it “harder for scammers to profit” from a presence on the social platform.In March, the world’s biggest search engine, Google, updated its Financial Services policy and will ban cryptocurrency-related adverts of all types in June 2018.",2
"Kraken: NY Attorney General’s Inquiry ‘Publicity Stunt,’ Japan’s VC Act ‘Good Example’",Molly Jane Zuckerman,2018-04-24 00:20:00,10435,147,"Crypto exchange Kraken has responded to the New York Attorney General’s (NYAG) inquiry launched last week into cryptocurrency exchanges, calling the initiative a “publicity stunt,” and referring to Japan’s virtual currencies act as a “good example” of “relatively” reasonable regulation, according to a blog post April 22.Attorney General (AG) Eric T. Schneiderman launched the “Virtual Markets Integrity Initiative” on April 17 by sending letters to 13 cryptocurrency exchanges, giving them a two-week deadline to answer a three-page questionnaire covering topics like market manipulation, preventing insider trading, and customer funds protection. Kraken writes that this initiative “comes off as a publicity stunt,” adding that they “would have given the same response to the AG of North Korea.”Kraken states they found the NYAG’s initiative offensive, saying that the two-week deadline is too short, the questions are “irrelevant,” and most of the information asked for is either available on their website, was already provided to government bodies, or is confidential due to security reasons or as trade secrets.Kraken also points out that they have no New York customers, as they left after the implementation of the BitLicense:“AG demands Kraken, which has no NY clients, to assist in protecting NY consumers (presumably against those who have obtained the BitLicense), without offering any sort of compensation for the professional consulting work.”Kraken ends their criticism of the AG’s inquiry by suggesting the future possibility of working with the government on regulation if it is “rational”:“We would be happy to work with the NYAG and the NYDFS (again) on a strategy for replacing the BitLicense with something rational [...] We would do this for free, as a gift to the people of New York [but] Making surprise, public, unreasonable demands is not getting off on the right foot toward re-establishing trust and building a relationship.”Kraken then elaborates on their recent decision to leave the Japanese market, citing more scrutiny in the wake of the Coincheck hack in January. However, they note that Japan’s Virtual Currency Act is a “a good example of what (relatively) reasonable regulation can do for a country,” adding that “hopefully, Kraken will find an opportunity to re-enter the market in the near future.”Kraken notes that the biggest crypto exchanges have already been collaborating on crime reduction, especially in regards to freezing stolen funds that have been moved to different exchanges.Kraken concludes that regulators should consult organizations that have already set good regulatory examples:“Rather than handing down commandments from the ivory tower, regulators ought to seek the expertise of these businesses who have survived and managed to earn the trust of consumers and law enforcement over the years [...]”",[]
U.S. Court Rules Money Laundering-Related Case Against Coinbase Must Have Public Trial,Molly Jane Zuckerman,2018-04-23 23:29:00,15400,225,"A U.S. federal court has ruled that law firm Silver Miller’s money laundering-related class action lawsuit against crypto exchange and wallet Coinbase must be held in open court as opposed to a private arbitration boardroom, Silver Miller attorney David Silver told Cointelegraph in an email today, April 23.The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruled today that the class action against Coinbase, brought by Silver Miller and co-counsel the Wites Law Firm, will be held in open court. The case in question alleges that Coinbase assisted in laundering around $8.2 mln of stolen Bitcoin (BTC) – valued at over $100 mln today. In July, 2017, the CEO of the now bankrupt crypto exchange Cryptsy, Paul Vernon, had been found guilty of stealing his users’ cryptocurrency and as ordered to pay $8.2 mln in damages, a case Silver Miller law firm was also involved in.As Vernon used his Coinbase account to convert the stolen funds into fiat between 2014 and 2016 before fleeing the country, the current Silver Miller class action lawsuit against Coinbase alleges negligence in account oversight:“Plaintiffs seek damages based upon the unlawful conduct of COINBASE in failing to properly monitor customer accounts that held investors’ money and ignoring its duty to investigate suspicious activities under U.S. anti-money laundering rules.”Silver Miller co-founder David Silver, who was part of the original Cryptsy lawsuit, told Cointelegraph that he has long “preached that accountability, transparency, and verification are needed in the crypto exchange space”:“This ruling brings the plaintiffs one step closer to finding out just what type of Know Your Customer protocols and Anti-Money-Laundering protections Coinbase employed and whether Coinbase complied with state and federal statutes in that regard.  Coinbase has delayed and tried to keep discovery hidden from the public long enough. That stops now.”Miller added that the law firm is “pleased” that the case will be a public trial:“Coinbase’s ascension to the top of the crypto exchange heap has not come without missteps in its business practices along the way.  We look forward to having Coinbase answer for its role in the millions of dollars in harm suffered by our clients.”Coinbase is currently the subject of multiple disputes from users, including a complaint filed in March of this year that alleges that the exchange benefited from insider trading when it added Bitcoin Cash (BCH) to its exchange and wallet services. On the merchant side, Coinbase has recently received backlash online from its reported decision to suspend the account of the WikiLeaks Shop, the official merchandise arm of the whistle-blowing Wikileaks organization.",1
Indian Exchange Coinsecure Prepares Customer Claims Process Following $3.5 mln Theft,Marie Huillet,2018-04-23 21:21:00,8932,192,"Indian Bitcoin (BTC) exchange Coinsecure says it has started work on the claims process for customer funds lost in the theft of 438 BTC ($3.5 mln) from the exchange’s wallet earlier this month, in an update posted on its website April 21.The Coinsecure Team said it has been “flooded with calls and emails” regarding disbursement of the stolen funds, but that its legal team was working “tirelessly” with authorities, which was consuming most of its time. It further said that it expects the claims form will soon be ready and that customers will be able to submit their claims requests by next weekend.The theft, which has affected around 11,000 customers according to local newspaper The Economic Times, allegedly occurred when CSO Amitabh Saxena incorrectly extracted funds from the exchange's cold wallet. Saxena reportedly was online when private keys were extracted, a mistake Coinsecure calls ""unacceptable"".The company itself has officially stated that the CSO’s claim regarding what went wrong “does not seem convincing”, also saying that “too many coincidences noticed for a hack of this nature to occur.” Coinsecure has filed a formal complaint with Indian authorities asking that Saxena’s passport be seized.In a press release April 13, Coinsecure offered a 10 percent bounty to anyone in the crypto community offering information that could lead to the recovery of the siphoned funds. The exchange pledged to refund customers’ BTC holdings in full, assuming they will recover the siphoned BTC. If not, 90 percent of lost funds will be returned in Indian rupees, with 10 percent in BTC at locked rates as of April 9. This means customers could lose nearly 34 percent in BTC value gains, as BTC traded around $6,700 April 9, and currently stands at $8,932 at press time.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been toughening its stance on crypto-related dealings, beginning to scrutinize accounts held by country’s top exchanges, including Coinsecure, in January 2018. RBI announced that it is banning all regulated entities from dealing with cryptocurrencies on April 5.",2
Third Co-Founder Of Centra Tech Charged With $25 Mln Securities Fraud,Molly Jane Zuckerman,2018-04-21 10:32:00,16829,240,"The third co-founder of crypto financial services startup Centra Tech Raymond Trapani has been arrested yesterday, April 20, and charged with securities and wire fraud of more than $25 mln associated with the company’s Initial Coin Offering (ICO), according to the US Department of Justice’s (DOJ) press release April 20.The two other co-founders, Sohrab Sharma and Robert Farkas, were arrested and charged of the same offenses earlier in April. Sharma, Farkas, and the now also arrested Raymond Trapani advertised the “Centra Card,” a debit card that was reportedly backed by Visa and Mastercard, which allowed users to convert crypto into fiat currencies.The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reports that no partnership actually existed between Centra and the two credit card companies.According to the DOJ’s press release, after the founder of an unrelated allegedly fraudulent ICO was arrested last fall, Sharma asked Trapani and Farkas to remove all false information, “fufu,” about Centra’s deal with Visa from their website: “I rather cut any fufu . . . Now . . . Then worry . . . Anything that doesn’t exist current . . . We need to remove.”New York Times writer Nathaniel Popper tweeted an excerpt of the SEC’s complaint against Trapani, referring to the problems the Centra Tech founders ran into by using random people’s photographs as their “team members” online. One solution to the issue of needing to remove the photos when people complained was to invent a fake car accident to kill the fake CEO and his fake wife:it is amazing what hoops you have to jump through when you create fake people and install them as your top executives, but then have to get rid of them pic.twitter.com/yIoAtW2JZRIn the DOJ’s press release, Deputy U.S. Attorney Robert Khuzami said,“As alleged, Raymond Trapani conspired with his co-defendants to lure investors with false claims about their product and about relationships they had with credible financial institutions.  While investing in virtual currencies is legal, lying to deceive investors is not.”Centra Tech had been promoted by celebrities like boxer Floyd Mayweather and DJ Khaled.

In Apparent Exit Scam CEO Of German Startup Is ‘Over And Out’ After $50 Mln ICO,Molly Jane Zuckerman,2018-04-18 20:55:00,47500,625,"Update: Thursday, April 19, Savedroid’s CEO posted a video to YouTube claiming that the apparent exit scam was actually a PR stunt the company pulled off to advocate for “high quality ICO standards.”The founder of German-based startup Savedroid has allegedly disappeared after raising a reported $50 mln through both an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) and private funding, according to local news outlet WirtschaftsWoche, today April 18.CEO and founder Yassin Hankir apparently left the intention behind his disappearance fairly clear with the following tweet, posted earlier today, apparently in Egypt:Thanks guys! Over and out ... #savedroidICO pic.twitter.com/PMRtjlbEdDSavedroid’s ICO website now shows nothing but a fullscreen South Park meme:Social media promptly reacted to the apparent exit scam, with self-described Bitcoin (BTC) alternative BitCoin ONE (BTCONE) posting on Twitter that if Savedroid turned out to be scam, they would donate 100,000 BTCONE to the victims. YouTube user Theo Goodman uploaded a video of today, reportedly of the empty Savedroid office, with a voiceover saying that he “can’t really confirm anything.”Finance Magnates writes that Savedroid allowed people to participate in the ICO with 56 types of cryptocurrencies, as opposed to many ICOs, which only accept BTC and ETH.According to what appears to be Savedroid’s only official online presence left standing with an explanation of what the startup is, subreddit /r/savedroid_ico describes Savedroid as “building a user interface that will make a cryptocurrency investment just as simple as a savings account. Our mission is to eliminate adoption barriers and make cryptocurrencies accessible for everyone!”CEO Hankir, the sardonic Twitter poster, was interviewed about his “success” at the Deutsche Börse Fintech Hub in 2017, and the Deutsche Börse Venture Network also wrote about Savedroid’s self-reported 20 mln pound funding in 2017.A German fintech founder close to Savedroid told WirtschaftsWoche that it is possibly a PR stunt, similar to what Tesla’s Elon Musk pulled on April Fool’s day.A post earlier today on the /r/savedroid_ico subreddit writes that all of the admins have left the Savedroid ICO Telegram group as well. The Telegram group, which has over 51,000 members, appears to now have been taken over by different scammers and bots posting lists of numbers and the phrase “CANT HIDE, FEAR FOR YOU LIFE” over and over.Today Cointelegraph reported on the five largest scams in crypto history, the highest of which is a Vietnamese outfit that allegedly stole $660 mln from investors through two ICOs, after which the operators went silent.",[]
"Mt. Gox, Coincheck, Binance and More: How Exchanges Are Learning to Deal With Cyberattacks",Gareth Jenkinson,2018-03-19 11:56:00,21031,350,"While Bitcoin may have revolutionized the way we look at transactions and banking, the brief nine-year existence of cryptocurrencies has been checkered with some monumental hackings and thefts.In a constantly evolving space, Blockchain technology is pushing the envelope while battling against attacks from all sides. Unfortunately, criminality is a reality, but there has been some drastic changes in the way cryptocurrency exchanges are reacting to cyber attacks.The crypto world had witnessed some monumental heists. Almost all of them are completely different but what is more important is how the teams in charge of these exchanges have gone about addressing these attacks.Let’s take a look at a number of instances involving some of the biggest exchange operators over the past nine years.Mt. Gox stands out as the most notorious incident since Bitcoin’s inception and it set the bar pretty high in terms of the effect it had on the cryptocurrency world, Bitcoin’s value and sentiments towards virtual currencies.The theft of over 850,000 Bitcoin has made headlines over the past four years and has been a major talking point in March. At the height of its power in 2013, Mt. Gox was the biggest exchange in the world responsible for around 80 percent of all Bitcoin transactions.As Cointelegraph sets out in this short memoir, the series of events that led to the so-called hack amounted to $473 mln worth of Bitcoin going missing. The circumstances surrounding the hack are still not crystal clear, but a number of people were arrested for their involvement in the embezzlement of funds stolen.Once again, it’s hard to refer to Mt. Gox as a hack, as then CEO Mark Karpelès was charged with embezzlement and fraud for his involvement in the movement of some of the ‘lost funds,’ not to mention various associates that were implicitly involved in the debacle.Fast forward to 2018, this modern-day hack has the unfortunate title of the biggest cryptocurrency hack in history if we’re talking about the value of the virtual currency that was stolen.While it’s not clear how it happened, a hacker gained access to the private key of the Coincheck online wallet and moved 523 mln NEM coins roughly worth $500 mln.The exchange was crucified for its poor security standards and the fact that such a large amount of cryptocurrency tokens were kept in a single address.Nevertheless, unlike Mt. Gox, the exchange worked swiftly to reduce the damage done by canceling transactions, ruled out a hard fork to undo the damage and actually managed to create a tagging system that allowed them to track all of the stolen NEM coins.Having flagged the stolen cryptocurrency, hackers were unable to sell or convert their loot on different exchanges. Furthermore, Coincheck vowed to begin repaying users for lost funds, which they’ve already started doing.Renowned as the largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume, Binance is the most recent big player to hit by a cyber attack.Unlike the insider job at Mt. Gox and the stolen private key at Coincheck, Binance were somewhat perplexed by a far more sophisticated modus operandi. However, miraculously or not, the exchange’s security systems picked up the suspicious activity and the hackers were unable to make off with any stolen coin.On March 7 numerous users started complaining on Reddit and social media platforms that unauthorized transactions were being made on their accounts.According to the Binance team, the hackers used phishing websites to hijack users’ login information. Once they’d acquired enough accounts, they created trading API keys with the user accounts.Then on March 7, the hackers used the keys and placed buy orders on the VIA/BTC market which pushed the price up. VIA tokens had been moved to 31 specific accounts, sold at the highest price, which would have moved BTC from compromised accounts to the 31 accounts.Bitgrail is another exchange that suffered one of the most recent cyber attacks. The Italian exchange lost 17 mln Nano tokens, estimated at around $187 mln in value, in suspicious circumstances.Bitgrail founder Francesco Firano maintains the fault lies with the Nano development team and its Blockchain, while the Nano team has refuted those claims in exclusive interviews with Cointelegraph.They’ve since announced that refunds will be made to users, but Bitgrail users have to sign an agreement that effectively rules out any future legal action against the Italian exchange.Another instance that made big headlines was the hacking of mining service Nicehash. Over 4,000 Bitcoin, worth around $63 mln at the time, was stolen by hackers from the Nicehash wallet.The popular service did well to consolidate after the attack. A change of CEO saw them resume their services after a few weeks and they pledged to refund all users affected by the cybertheft, which started in February 2018.What is abundantly clear is that we’ve come a long way from the Mt. Gox debacle.In the wake of that incident, users were effectively left in the lurch, with no hope of any restitution or reimbursement. After the hack, Mt. Gox applied for bankruptcy, in an effort to save themselves without any consideration for the thousands of users who lost funds in the infamous heist.We’re still dealing with the after-effects of Mt. Gox to this day. Last week, news broke that Mt. Gox trustees had been selling large amounts of Bitcoin to reimburse creditors as the markets spiraled after lofty December all-time highs.If that wasn’t bad enough, the sell-off went in excess of $400 mln and is being blamed for the market lows experienced by Bitcoin in 2018.All the while the FBI continues it’s investigation - focusing on a UK based shell company that is believed to have laundered 650,000 BTC.It’s a complete shambles.Luckily, those responsible for Coincheck and Binance have been far more proactive.Coincheck admittedly dropped the ball but the steps they took, and the speed in which they took them stopped the cyberthieves from successfully selling stolen NEM coins.They didn’t opt for bankruptcy and worked tirelessly to come to a solution that avoided a hard fork. Furthermore, they’ve started reimbursing users affected by the hack out of their funds.Binance managed to stop hackers from getting away with stolen tokens, but they’ve also raised the bar in the wake of the cyberattack.The exchange has promised to award anyone with information that would lead to the arrest of the hackers responsible for the attack. The equivalent of $250,000 in Binance Coin is the bounty on offer.The latter two exchanges have shown that there has been a massive change in the attitude of exchanges towards their users and the cryptocurrency community as a whole. They’ve gone to great lengths to ensure that those affected have been reimbursed as quickly as possible.Bitgrail has come under heavy pressure from the cryptocurrency community. The Italian exchange was loathed to admit full responsibility for the theft, but like Binance and Coincheck they’ve announced plans to refund customers in the near future.As reported by Cointelegraph, Bitgail users seeking reimbursements will have to agree to settlement terms which prevent them from taking future legal action against Bitgrail. It’s a cheeky move, but if you get your money back is it really worth following that up with a lawsuit?All in all, Bitgrail’s latest move doesn’t leave a good taste in the mouth.One can only hope we are not witnessing another Mt Gox in the making, as the exchange seems to be putting itself first and its users very much second.Taking all these different examples into account, it seems the way cryptocurrency service providers react to cyberattacks is almost entirely dependent on the ethics and credibility of respective management teams.",9
Australian Taxation Office Reports Scammers Collecting Bitcoin On Its Behalf,Helen Partz,2018-03-16 01:19:00,17103,213,"The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) has recently issued a warning about a new type of scam claiming fake tax debt on behalf of ATO, and requesting tax payment via Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies in a public release updated on March 14.In the warning, ATO Assistant Commissioner Kath Anderson stated that the new kind of scam first appeared in 2017. The ATO imposters claimed to accept new tax payment methods, such as digital currency.According to Anderson, the scammers managed to get over $50,000 in BTC as a ‘tax payment’ in 2017. Anderson emphasized the fact that it is impossible to get back the cryptocurrency funds lost to scammers, highlighting its generally anonymous nature:“Scammers are constantly adapting their methods to maximise their chances of picking your pocket. Unfortunately it was inevitable that scammers would target cryptocurrency given its current popularity and anonymity.”The amount lost in Bitcoin is considerably low to compare with other fake tax debt frauds, however. The ATO reports that overall funds lost in 2017 amounted to about $2.4 mln with over 80,000 reports received by the agency. ATO concluded their warning with tips to the public on how to avoid similar scams.In other crypto-related scams, imposters have recently taken to using Twitter to steal funds, posing to be famous figures such as billionaire Elon Musk and Litecoin creator Charlie Lee announcing fake giveaways.On March 2, ATO announced that it is planning to track down those who evade paying taxes on their cryptocurrency transactions this year. In May 2017, the Australian government confirmed that it would treat Bitcoin “just like money,” and that it would no longer be subject to double taxation.",[]
"Microsoft Blocked More Than 400,000 Malicious Cryptojacking Attempts In One Day",Molly Jane Zuckerman,2018-06-21 02:55:14,32879,490,"Microsoft’s Windows Defender Antivirus has blocked an attack of more than 400,000 attempts over a span of 12 hours for trojans to infect users with a cryptocurrency miner, according to a Microsoft blog post on March 7.Windows Defender’s research showed that a little before noon (PST) on March 6, Windows Defender Antivirus began detecting these sophisticated trojans, which are new variants of an application called Dofoil (or Smoke Loader), attempting to inject cryptocurrency mining malwares through “advanced cross-process injection techniques, persistence mechanisms, and evasion methods.”The majority, or 73 percent, of these instances came from Russia, with 18 percent from Turkey and 4 percent from Ukraine.Even though Dofoil uses a code injection technique that runs crypto mining malware disguised as a legitimate Windows binary, Windows Defender Antivirus behavior monitoring flagged trojan injections as threats because the network traffic from this binary, wuauclt.exe, is suspicious as well as running from the wrong location.Dofoil, which Microsoft describes as the “latest malware family to incorporate coin miners in attacks,” used the NiceHash crypto cloud mining marketplace that supports a variety of cryptocurrencies. Microsoft notes that the samples they inspected mined Electroneum coins.Cryptojacking has become more prevalent recently, with more than 55 percent of businesses worldwide affected by crypto mining attacks as of January 2018.In mid-February, a malicious crypto mining script was injected into software for helping blind and partially-sighted people go online, affecting more than 5000 websites, including those of the UK government. Earlier in February, a malware for mining Monero was discovered to have infiltrated around 7000 Android devices mainly in China and South Korea.",1

McAfee Suspects North Korea In Recent Cyberattack On Turkish Financial Sector,Ana Alexandre,2018-03-09 00:30:00,27417,280,"North Korean hackers are suspected in a cyberattack on Turkey’s financial sector, as stated in a report released by McAfee March 8.The McAfee Advanced Threat Research team identified an attempt by the hacking group Hidden Cobra to breach the security of Turkish government-backed financial institutions on March 2 and 3.While McAfee policy is to not officially identify cyber groups from nation-states as culprits, they mention in the report that the code of the malware in question closely resembles code used by a hacking operative associated with North Korea.The hackers used modified malware known as a “Bankshot” which utilized a recently revealed vulnerability in Adobe Flash. The attackers tried to lure their victims with spear-phishing emails containing an infected Microsoft Word file named Agreement.docx.The file appeared to be an agreement template for Bitcoin distribution between an unknown individual in Paris and a to-be-determined cryptocurrency exchange, the report says.Bankshot implants were distributed from a domain similar to the cryptocurrency-lending platform Falcon Coin, but the malicious domain falcancoin.io was created December 27, 2017, and is not legally associated with the original platform.Though there have been no reports of stolen money in the attacks, the research team believes the campaign intended to get remote access to the internal systems of the targeted government-controlled financial organizations. The report, however, does not reveal which specific organizations were affected.The McAfee team also discovered two documents written in Korean, which appear to be part of the same hacking campaign, but were intended for different targets.Back in December 2017, the US government issued a warning about Bankshot malware, linking it to Hidden Cobra, a group of hackers the U.S. Government considers malicious cyber-criminals working for the North Korean government.North Korea has been repeatedly accused of hacking South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges, as international sanctions against the country have tightened over the past year.",6

ABC reports that no charges have yet been filed, and both the AFP and the Bureau of Meteorology have declined to comment pending the ongoing investigation.Chris Berg from the RMIT Blockchain Innovation Hub told ABC that the suspected employees could either have been using the bureau's computational power to mine for crypto, or using its electricity to avoid paying their own electrical bills:""One possibility is that they're trying to use some of the equipment that the Bureau of Meteorology have [sic]. The Bureau of Meteorology has some very fast computers. Another possibility, though, is that they're just trying to get the Bureau of Meteorology to pay for the electricity. Mining is a very electricity-intensive task and they probably didn't want to pay for it themselves.""Last month, in a similar such plot, several Russian nuclear engineers were arrested after attempting to use one of Russia’s largest supercomputers for crypto mining.",2

US: Federal Prosecutors Ask For Forfeiture Of 500 BTC,Molly Jane Zuckerman,2018-03-02 19:32:00,25114,211,"Federal prosecutors are seeking the forfeiture of more than 500 Bitcoin (BTC) (worth about about $5.5 mln) seized during the investigation of a group producing fake identity documents, according to the Ohio Department of Justice’s March 1 news release.A federal grand jury has indicted four people from Ohio for producing and transferring fake driver’s licenses and ID cards from different states across the US.Along with the BTC, prosecutors are also asking for the forfeiture of more than $8,000 in cash, as well as gold and silver coins and bars equal to around $265,000. If the prosecutors win the case, then the BTC, along with the other listed assets, will be seized by the government.The US government has previously sold confiscated Bitcoin following criminal convictions.

"Stolen Coincheck NEM Found In Exchanges In Canada, Japan, Law Enforcement To Be Informed",Molly Jane Zuckerman,2018-03-02 12:49:00,20823,216,"Researchers at the BIG Blockchain Intelligence Group Inc. have traced some of the $534 mln in NEM (XEM) stolen in the Jan. 26 Coincheck hack to a Vancouver-based crypto exchange, according to their March 1 press release.The Japan Communist Party Central Committee’s newspaper also reported today, March 2, that 24 mln NEM coins from the hack are currently in Japanese NEM exchange Zaif.The Japanese newspaper reported that since Tech Bureau, the operator of Zaif, is registered with the Financial Services Agency, it is obliged to confirm a customer’s identity, which can “help to clarify the identity of the criminal.”  The article added that Tech Bureau had not responded to a request for comment by press time.The stolen NEM are able to be traced thanks to the NEM development team’s new tagging system that alerts crypto exchange when an account has been tagged for containing stolen funds, with the following messages attached onto the 11 wallet addresses of the hackers:“coincheck_stolen_funds_do_not_accept_trades : owner_of_this_account_is_hacker.”This automatic tagging system means that cryptocurrency exchanges are able to easily identify the addresses the hackers and forbid them from converting the NEM into other cryptocurrencies or fiat.A Cointelegraph article covering the tagging system wrote that due to the “sheer size” of the stolen NEM, it is “not likely that the hackers will go through small-scale cryptocurrency exchanges to convert or launder the stolen funds [...] At this stage, the only safe option for the hackers is to hold onto the stolen NEM.”However, according to BIG, the hackers were attempting to move the stolen NEM through the Vancouver-based exchange and then possibly sending them back to Japan. Bloomberg writes that Shone Anstey, the president and co-founder of BIG, declined to name the exchange, the amount of NEM involved in the transaction, and its alleged destination in Japan.6 of the 11 wallet addresses used in the hack have been moving small amount of NEM since January, in values from 1 to over 10,000 coins.One of these addresses contained a message in Japanese in its latest March 1 transfer of around 7 NEM coins:“This purchase is to determine the bitcoin address of the criminal, insist that the purpose is not for self profit.”The other 5 wallet addresses have been moving large amounts, ranging from a little less than 300,000 NEM to increments of 5, 10, and 20 mln on one account from February through March 1.Anstey told Bloomberg that it was the size of the NEM transactions at the Canadian exchange that alerted BIG’s Forensic and Investigations Division:“We felt it was a significant amount that warranted looking into. They are trying to move it before the door is closed, but there is a lot to move.”BIG, described on its website as a “developer of Blockchain technology search and data analytics solutions,” wrote that it will compile all data of its findings to send to law enforcement in both Canada and the US.",4
Steve Wozniak ‘Loses 7 BTC’ In Unlikely Credit Card Fraud,William Suberg,2018-02-27 16:04:00,43208,209,"Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak allegedly lost seven bitcoins to fraudsters using a stolen credit card, the India Economic Times reported Monday, Feb. 26.The tech veteran was speaking at the Global Business Summit 2018 in New Delhi when India Economic Times reported him admitting to the audience he had lost the funds - seven bitcoins to be exact - now worth about $75,000.“I had seven bitcoins stolen from me through fraud. Somebody bought them from me online through a credit card and they cancelled the credit card payment. It was that easy!” the publication quotes him as saying.“And it was from a stolen credit card number so you can never get it back.”Despite multiple publications subsequently picking up on the story, Wozniak has yet to confirm more information about the theft, and the unusual circumstances surrounding the loss.The trade appeared to have closed with Wozniak sending the bitcoins before receiving the fiat funds - something p2p cryptocurrency trading platforms such as Localbitcoins firmly warn users against doing.It remains unclear whether Localbitcoins or other major platform was used for the trade, and whether an escrow feature - that would have prevented the possibility of credit card fraud - was available.Nonetheless, the weak link allowing the fraud to be successful appears to lie either in the susceptibility of credit card data to fraud or human error in sending bitcoins without confirmation of funds receipt.Consumer complaints surrounding cryptocurrency “scams” have increased markedly over the past year, even involving Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, Cointelegraph reported this month, yet a lack of diligence on the consumers’ part remains palpable.",5

"Tesla Cryptojacked, Hackers Use Passwordless System To Mine Crypto",Molly Jane Zuckerman,2018-02-21 11:02:00,31579,393,"Cloud security intelligence (CSI) firm RedLock has exposed a new case of cryptojacking targeting Tesla’s Amazon Web Service’s (AWS) software container, the RedLock blog reported yesterday, Feb. 20.Hackers accessed Tesla’s AWS access credentials by penetrating a non-password protected Kubernetes software container. The hackers then used the Kubernetes container to mine for cryptocurrencies, for an as of yet unknown amount of time.RedLock’s CSI team exposed a similar hack of AWS for Bitcoin (BTC) mining purposes at companies Aviva and Gemaltо in October of last year. These companies, like Tesla, did not have passwords for their admin consoles.The Tesla hack was well disguised--the hackers didn’t use an already-known mining pool, but instead put in their own mining pool software than connected the malicious script to an “unlisted” endpoint, complicating the ability to detect any suspicious activity.The hackers also kept their CPU usage low to prevent being spotted, and hid the mining pool’s IP address behind free content delivery network CloudFlare, RedLock reports.Tesla had already made the news last year for an innovative way to use their technologies to mine Bitcoin in a way completely unintended by the company. In December 2017, the owner of a Tesla S electric car reported that he had been mining Bitcoin with his car’s supercharger, placing a mining rig in the trunk.RedLock’s blog post detailing the hack, titled, “Lessons from the Cryptojacking Attack at Tesla,” ends with suggestions to companies to prevent similar cryptojacking incidents in the future, namely monitoring configurations, network traffic, and suspicious user behavior.And, as TechCruch adds, “at least [using] a password.”",4
Don’t Believe the Hype. Five Largest ICO “Exit Scams”: Expert Take,Brian Kean,2018-02-19 23:59:00,70952,530,"In our Expert Takes, opinion leaders from inside and outside the crypto industry express their views, share their experience and give professional advice. Expert Takes cover everything from Blockchain technology and ICO funding to taxation, regulation, and cryptocurrency adoption by different sectors of the economy.If you would like to contribute an Expert Take, please email your ideas and CV to a.mcqueen@cointelegraph.comThe majority of the world's financial markets are now tightly regulated, and for that reason, fraud is becoming increasingly rare. Enterprising scammers are turning to fintech innovation which is currently unregulated – cryptocurrency.Essentially, a crypto scammer aims to persuade 'unwitting investors' to buy fake coins by transferring either fiat currencies or cryptocurrencies. In this column we will only focus on the so-called ‘ICO exit’ scam, not thefts, hacks or Ponzi schemes.We define a project as a scam only when it is proven that the money collected during a pre-ICO or ICO was stolen and the team has disappeared. This means the fraud was preplanned and the theft of investor funds deliberate.The PlexCoin ICO was halted in December 2017 by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in response to an official complaint that founder Dominic Lacroix was defrauding American and Canadian investors. The complaint alleged that Lacroix was advertising an astronomically high return of 1,354% (that the SEC determined was unable to be delivered), pushing forward a group of fake experts to bring legitimacy to his project, and trying to obscure his past financial crimes, which included defrauding investors in a micro-loan venture.The SEC has frozen all of the $15 million gathered by the ICO from its launch in August 2017. Lacroix was jailed, and the PlexCoin parent company fined $100,000. About $810,000 was still being held by payment processing company Stripe while the rest of the funds were located in various cryptocurrency wallets belonging to the Lacroix. It’s unclear exactly what charges will be brought against Lacroix and what will happen to the money deposited in his wallets. However, PlexCoin was one of the largest attempted ICO exit scams in history, which thankfully was nipped in the bud.Benebit claimed to use a Blockchain token system to unify customer loyalty programs, like frequent flyer miles. This ICO had all the trappings of legitimacy, including a moderated Telegram channel with over 9,000 members, a marketing budget of over $500,000, and promotions for the token pre-sale. With a novel concept, a serious-sounding white paper, and some well-spent marketing dollars, the Benebit team were able to generate a good deal of hype, and investors began to buy in.However, things started to go south when someone noticed that photos of the team appeared to have been stolen from a UK school for boys. Passport details provided by the ‘founders,’ were all fake. After this revelation, the team behind the scam began pulling down anything related to Benebit, including the website, white paper, and social media accounts. Estimates vary, but the scammers are believed to have walked away with at least $2.7 million and as much as $4 million.A motivated community of small-time investors who put money into Opair and Ebitz are trying to track down a mysterious developer known only as Wasserman, the apparent mastermind behind two ICO scams which netted a combined total of 388 BTC.Opair promoted a decentralized debit card system using its own token, XPO. Users discovered that the LinkedIn profiles of some of the team were fake and Opair rapidly vanished, but not before generating just under 190 BTC in its ICO in the summer of 2016.Amateur investigations carried out by duped investors revealed that the mail servers for Ebitz were rerouting to the domain of Opair, which billed itself as a clone of ZCash with some small changes. The team, a self-described “group of ethical hackers,” were hoping to raise 500 BTC through their ICO, which started on November 28 2016. In two days users of BitcoinTalk spotted the shady connection of Ebitz’ MX records to Opair.The Ebitz website was taken down soon afterwards, but the ICO did manage to gather about 200 BTC before disappearing; although many users speculate that the BTC mostly came from the developers to provide ‘fake volume,’ or the impression that many people had already invested in the project in order to boost trust and lure other investors to buy their token.On the face of it, REcoin (Real Estate coin) and DRC (Diamond Reserve Club) tried to do something ambitious and daring - create a cryptocurrency that was backed up with real-world assets - real estate and diamonds. Their founder Maksim Zaslavskiy claimed that both startups were fully staffed, lawyered up, and had already formed relationships with retailers and investors - none of which was true.The SEC alleges that neither REcoin nor DRC had any “real operations”, that both startups had misrepresented their total level of investment, and that neither of the proposed projects had any tokens or anything to do with Blockchain whatsoever. SEC decided that REcoin and DRC weren’t ICOs at all and were actually securities, which led to Zaslavskiy’s arrest on September 29 2017. According to the SEC, Zaslavskiy did manage to rake in about $300,000 before being caught, despite he initially saying that funds raised from both ICOs amounted to over $2 million.Yes, PonziCoin is a real cryptocurrency, and yes, some very gullible people were separated from their money after investing in it. Even more surprising, the most recent PonziCoin, which bills itself as “the world’s first legitimate Ponzi scheme,” is actually the second PonziCoin to exist. The first one came out in 2014 and made off with about $7,000 in cryptocurrency, which by some estimates could have been worth over $2 million today.Another PonziCoin project appeared in 2017 using the same web address.Initially intended as a gag, it featured a public and open admission on its website that it was a scam. However, that didn’t stop some investors from pouring money into the ‘product.’ In total, a project, which openly admitted to being a scam, raised over $250,000, and, surprise, surprise, the ‘founder’ ran away with the cash (after being baffled that anyone would invest at all given their openness and honesty).ICO exit scams thrive in the current environment of unbelievable profits, overwhelming hype, and the time-constrained nature of ICOs, which make investors feel like they need to invest quickly or risk losing out on a good deal. No matter if you are just starting out or are a seasoned investor, every single decision needs to be analyzed thoroughly - there is no substitute for due diligence. If you are considering investing in an ICO, we highly recommend taking the following steps:We believe that cryptocurrency is the future and that this current period of uncertainty is temporary, it is still wise to be cautious and prudent before investing your hard earned fiat or cryptocurrency in new ventures.The views and interpretations in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily represent the views of Cointelegraph.",16
Crypto ‘Scams’ Have Affected Over 1.2k Australian Investors In 2017,William Suberg,2018-02-19 13:39:00,26023,235,"Cryptocurrency “scams” generated over 1200 complaints to Australia’s consumer watchdog in 2017, according to new figures it released this month.Local news media outlet ABC reports data it obtained from the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC) reveals 1289 complaints, some of which appear to relate to token offerings.Australia has remained quiet against the recent backdrop of pledges by international regulators to keep a close eye on cryptocurrency token sales and related activities.As Cointelegraph reported on various occasions since the World Economic Forum 2018 late January, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has led plans for continued scrutiny on financial products subsequently repeated by entities including the European Union.While ABC does not state which specific operators the complaints refer to, one investor relates losses he suffered through use of controversial Australian exchange Igot, responsibility for which has since been transferred to Bitlio since an insolvency scam in 2016.“These are quite speculative products and they can be quite high-risk,” John Price, commissioner for financial regulator the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) meanwhile told the publication in broader comments.“It's been quite well documented that some of these products are scams, so please don't invest unless you're prepared to lose some or all of your money.”Scams even affect cryptocurrency’s best-known names, with Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin warning investors about a Twitter impersonator purporting to offer free money on his behalf.The fake giveaway even made the headlines in cryptocurrency news media, which erroneously reported it as legitimate.Cryptocurrency media is now, even if out of ignorance/stupidity, complicit in making twitter scams look more legit.Also, the ECF is *not* an EF initiative; it's an independent community organization with some EF participants as advisors.Shame, https://t.co/JE9wIWmITL. pic.twitter.com/aM4YpjJIP7 ",4
Cisco And Ukrainian Cyber Police Uncover $50 Mln Bitcoin Phishing Scam,Molly Jane Zuckerman,2018-02-15 13:10:00,25416,240,"Technology conglomerate Cisco and the Cyber Police of Ukraine have revealed a Ukrainian Bitcoin (BTC) phishing ring that has stole over $50 mln over a three year period, Cisco’s threat intelligence team Talos reports.Talos was first alerted to the phishing threat on Feb. 24, 2017, when a Ukrainian-based phishing scheme, COINHOARDER, targeted the blockchain.info wallet service through Google Ads that contained “gateway phishing links” and generating over 200,000 client search queries.The Google Ads would appear to represent the real blockchain.info Bitcoin wallet by using domain names that closely resembled that of the official wallet, like blockchein.info. The phishing sites themselves are also designed to match the real site in every way except for the domain name.Talos reports that COINHOARDER began making their phishing site look more legitimate over time by using rogue SSL certificates in combination with their “typosquatting,” “brand spoofing,” and “homograph attacks.”Talos found that the phishing targeted geographic areas where local currencies were unstable and English was not the first language of the region, like Nigeria and Ghana, for victims were more likely to miss the slight differences in the domain and SSL names.Cisco’s collaboration with the Cyber Police of Ukraine helped them identify the attackers’ BTC wallet address. Talos writes that “around $10 mln” alone was stolen while tracking the wallet’s activity from Sept. through Dec. 2017.After the discovery of this large-scale phishing scheme, Cisco began flagging the associated domains as suspicious, and used DNS requests to find and block other domains opened by the same registrant of the initial site.Talos ends their report with the list of the IP addresses associated with the phishing scam, as well as ways for Cisco customers to protect themselves against similar threats.Crypto phishing scams on Twitter have recently become much more prevalent, with users creating fake accounts that closely mimic those of crypto elites like Charlie Lee or Vitalik Buterin and then promoting fake crypto giveaways.",1
Mining Malware Tsunami Continues: ‘5000’ High-Profile UK Websites Hit By Tainted Plugin,William Suberg,2018-02-12 12:41:00,21627,227,"New cryptocurrency mining malware exploiting software for blind and partially-sighted people has infected “thousands” of websites including the UK Government, the Guardian reports Sunday, Feb. 11.As various media outlets report Monday, malicious script was injected into BrowseAloud, a plugin which assists those with reduced sight in accessing online content. Visitors to sites involved see their processing power used for mining - known colloquially as “cryptojacking.”Over 5000 websites are now infected, including the UK’s National Health Service (NHS), Student Loans Company and local authority sites.Commenting on the events, UK watchdog the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) said there was “nothing to suggest” consumers were at risk after damage control measures were implemented.“NCSC technical experts are examining data involving incidents of malware being used to illegally mine cryptocurrency,” a statement read Feb. 11.“The affected service has been taken offline, largely mitigating the issue. Government websites continue to operate securely. At this stage there is nothing to suggest that members of the public are at risk.”The news comes amid multiple warnings of similar malware propagation throughout the world, including Monero mining malware infecting Android devices this month.In January meanwhile, Cointelegraph reported on how third parties had managed to use YouTube to mine cryptocurrency by hijacking Google’s DoubleClick advertising platform.The NHS was one of the first and hardest-hit victims of 2017’s infamous WannaCry malware attack, which saw hackers demand $300 in bitcoin to unlock computers.",3
‘Fraudulent’ Bitstrade Platform Gets Cease And Desist Order From New Jersey Regulators,William Suberg,2018-02-11 17:05:00,44831,373,"Local US regulators of the state of New Jersey announced they had sent a cease and desist order to cryptocurrency investment platform Bitstrade Feb. 9, describing the business as “fraudulent.”A press release accompanying the “emergency order” warns that Bitstrade was not licensed to offer securities in the state of New Jersey, and that it was “violating the law” by not disclosing key information about its operations.The enforcement came courtesy of New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir S. Grewal, as well as its Division of Consumer Affairs, Bureau of Securities and Division of Law.The release states:“...[T]he Bureau found that Bitstrade is violating the State’s Uniform Securities Law by offering investors an unregistered security in the form of an investment pool that purportedly guarantees up to 10 percent returns which accrue daily on investor funds. Bitstrade is not registered to sell securities in New Jersey,”Regarding withholding information, the order makes specific reference to “failing to disclose key material facts to prospective investors, including the names of its executive officers, the address of its principal office, information about Bitstrade's financial condition, the risks of the Bitstrade Investment, and how Bitstrade invests investors’ money, the Bureau found.”The move comes just weeks after self-proclaimed “cryptocurrency bank” AriseBank was ordered to halt operations in the state of Texas and stop serving its residents.At the same time, US regulators at national level in the form of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) continue to urge caution on ICOs and similar offerings in the cryptocurrency industry.In a dedicated hearing on associated regulation Feb. 6, the chairmen of both agencies committed to “collaborating on… approaches to policing [cryptocurrency] markets for fraud and abuse.”“What makes Bitstrade’s fraudulent offer potentially more harmful for unsophisticated investors is that cryptocurrency is virtually anonymous, so there is no recourse for investors to recoup their losses,” Division of Consumer Affairs acting director Sharon Joyce meanwhile said about the New Jersey move.",2
Binance Vs. McAfee: Hack Rumors Controversy,Joseph Young,2018-02-11 15:05:00,56955,376,"For more than 24 hours, Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, was down due to a server issue on Feb. 7. On Feb. 9, Binance resumed trading after successfully rebooting its server.John McAfee, a security expert and a well-known public figure in the cryptocurrency space, continued to fuel controversy around Binance and rumors of hacking attacks, showing screenshots that circulated on various social media platforms.“I received dozens similar from a variety of sources. I'm not saying there was a hack. I'm merely asking for clarification. If a hack did happen and we are not immediately pursuing it, then the chances of recovery go to zero within 24 hours,” McAfee stated.Not trying to spread FUD, but I have received dozens of reports like this one. I'm just trying to understand. As a security researcher, I know that potential hacks are far more easy to solve if investigated immediately. Days later magnifies the task by orders of manitude. pic.twitter.com/u1PL9Z4tGfIn response to McAfee’s statement, which referenced a photoshopped image of the Binance website, the company’s CEO Changpeng Zhao stated:But you are spreading fud. We will prove you wrong. https://t.co/QTuK6t2ZS3Immediately after McAfee released several statements on the issue, the Binance team along with its CEO Changpeng Zhao refuted the rumors, stating that Binance was not hacked. Binance went as far as to transfer funds from its cold wallet to hot wallet to show that the exchange was not hacked.The Binance team also encouraged McAfee not to spread false information and provided evidence that funds on the exchange are safe by publicly showing the cryptocurrency wallet addresses of the exchange.Blockchain thankfully provides a public ledger that can disprove any FUD.If you would like to check for yourself, our wallet addresses are: 1NDyJtNTjmwk5xPNhjgAMu4HDHigtobu1s0x3f5ce5fbfe3e9af3971dd833d26ba9b5c936f0beHere you can see we have clearly not been compromised.Zhao added that the exchange did not experience a hack, but an issue with its server and the team focused on recovering its data to enable trading.Unfortunately, we will have to focus on restoring our system so that Mr. Mcafee can use our system to trade ASAP. Servicing our users is always the highest priority. Every Binancian is as important as Mr. Mcafee to us. We appreciate their patience and strong support. https://t.co/iZ4rlvon0tRecently, many cryptocurrency exchanges and trading platforms were hacked. Coincheck experienced a $530 mln hacking attack as reported by Cointelegraph and yesterday, the largest Nano (RaiBlocks) exchange BitGrail experienced a security breach.The difference between a hacking attack and a minor server issue is that with security breaches, anyone can verify the movement of absurdly large amounts of cryptocurrencies from the cryptocurrency exchange’s wallets to external wallets, as seen in the case of Coincheck.Hours before the Coincheck team admitted to a hacking attack, many members of the cryptocurrency community released evidence that hundreds of millions of dollars worth of NEM were moved from the wallet of Coincheck to external wallets.Thus, if there is no evidence that large sums of funds in cryptocurrencies are transferred from the wallets of a cryptocurrency exchange to external wallets, it is irresponsible to suggest the possibility of a hacking attack.On Feb. 11, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao released a personal statement on the recent Binance server issue and the actions of McAfee.“The real helper was Mr. Mcafee, posting an obviously fake image about us being hacked. Everyone pitched in to help defend us. He united the community for us, and rallied such support, during a time when we needed it the most. Sometimes, things that look negative are actually positive.”Cryptocurrency exchanges have similar daily trading volumes as stock markets in regions like South Korea. Trading platforms process billions of dollars on a daily basis. As such, upon the occurrence of a hacking attack or a security breach, cryptocurrency exchanges often contact the authorities and cooperate with law enforcement to investigate the attack, as Coincheck did last month. Also, given the size of most major cryptocurrency exchanges, it is irresponsible to suggest the possibility of hacking attacks or security breaches without hard evidence.",6
BitGrail Exchange Asks Devs of ‘Stolen’ Coin To Alter Ledger To ‘Cover Losses’,William Suberg,2018-02-10 18:25:00,52677,352,"Suspicion is growing around Italian cryptocurrency exchange BitGrail after its owner seemingly asked for a coin’s ledger to be changed after the exchange reported funds were missing Thursday, Feb 8.BitGrail, a lesser-known exchange in the cryptocurrency space, reportedly suffered losses of one of its hosted tokens, Nano (formerly known as Raiblocks), subsequently freezing trading. In a note on their website posted Feb. 9, the exchange stated that 17 million Nano had been stolen in the hack, an amount worth about $187 million at the time the losses were discovered.XRB withdrawals will be enabled again as soon as possible. Funds are safe, users still have access to them.Withdrawals that were pending since before this maintenance should have been completed.Reminder: withdrawals for other coins are available.Thank you for understanding.Feb. 9, a day after they were informed of the hack, Nano developers provided an official comment showing that BitGrail’s owner and operator Francesco “The Bomber” Firano had asked for the altcoin’s ledger to be altered.“...Firano informed us of missing funds from BitGrail’s wallet. An option suggested by Firano was to modify the ledger in order to cover his losses — which is not possible, nor is it a direction we would ever pursue,” Nano wrote in a Medium post.Nano promptly dropped almost 20% across exchanges in the past two days, while updates from BitGrail on social media have yet to appear, except for a tweet Feb. 8 saying Nano (XRB) markets were “currently unavailable”.XRB Markets currently unavailable.However, a Twitter user named Francesco the Bomber, allegedly Firano, posted a string of tweets about the hack, the most recent of which referenced “unfounded accusations...by the dev team”, likely a response to Nano’s post on Medium.The reputation of both Firano and BitGrail currently appears shaky, Nano continuing it considered his behavior “misleading.”“We now have sufficient reason to believe that Firano has been misleading the Nano Core Team and the community regarding the solvency of the BitGrail exchange for a significant period of time,” the  Nano post continues.The BitGrail debacle comes as dust continues to settle on Japanese exchange Coincheck’s giant $530mln hack late last month. Although accusations of foul play have been few, questions remain about security practices as state regulators conduct an ongoing major investigation.On Twitter, cryptocurrency industry commentators reacted cautiously, one likening Firano’s request to what happened in the DAO hack in June, 2016, after which Ethereum was hard-forked to refund users.Nano noted that even if Firano’s request were accepted, changing transaction history was “not possible”.",18
Wolf Of Wall Street Says Bitcoin Could Hit $50K Before Crashing,Molly Jane Zuckerman,2018-02-02 00:49:00,209280,694,"Jordan Belfort, known colloquially as the “Wolf of Wall Street”, has yet again cast doubt on Bitcoin, this time in a video interview with entrepreneur Patrick Bet-David, posted on Bet-David’s Facebook Jan. 31.Belfort told Bet-David that he doesn’t believe Bitcoin (BTC) itself is a scam, referring to it as the creation of “financial anarchists”. He does think, however, that the way the cryptocurrency was built is a “perfect storm for manipulation”.Belfort believes that the rising price of BTC can be attributed to wild speculation because of what he sees as improper use of the cryptocurrency:“Something [BTC] was designed to be used as a currency, and it’s being used as an investment vehicle [...] As a currency, Bitcoin is no more useful at $20,000 or $100.”Belfort spoke negatively about the potential for manipulating crypto markets due to the thinness of the market, specifically referencing the case of Olaf Carlson-Wee, an early adopter of BTC who was paid in crypto when working at Coinbase in 2013.According to Belfort, Carlson-Wee sold all of his Bitcoin, bought Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and then gave a televised interview saying that BTC was dead and that Bitcoin Cash was the future, causing its price to skyrocket.CT could not confirm that Carlson-Wee ever mentioned dumping all of his BTC for BCH, although he did give an interview to CNBC about Ethereum that some Reddit users misconstrued as Carlson-Wee moving all his holdings to Ether.Belfort predicts that while Bitcoin is, in his words, a “wolf in sheep’s clothing,”  it also “might go to $50,000” before what he is certain will be its eventual fall to zero.In September 2017, Belfort had said that Bitcoin was problematic because of the potential ease for hackers to steal virtual currency. In October, he commented that ICOs were the “biggest scams ever”.Belfort told Bet-David he had invested “not a penny” in cryptocurrency.",81

"UK: Cryptocurrency Trader Robbed ‘At Gunpoint’, Amount Stolen Unknown",Helen Partz,2018-01-30 15:35:00,27932,268,"Four masked robbers have broken into the house of a cryptocurrency trader in Moulsford, Oxfordshire and forced him to transfer all of his bitcoins to them “at gunpoint”, The Telegraph reports Sunday, Jan. 28.According to The Telegraph, this is the first case of cryptocurrency robbery in the UK.The criminals entered the house of a crypto trader and forced him to transfer his entire Bitcoin stash. The exact amount of bitcoins stolen has not yet been specified.Fortunately, the incident did not cause any serious injuries to anyone. The police immediately launched an investigation into the case, however, no arrests were made as of press time.The police have also asked for help from local citizens:""Officers are particularly interested in speaking to anyone travelling through [Moulsford] on the A329 Reading Road between 7.30am and 10.30am on Monday who has Dashcam footage or anyone with mobile phone footage.”Due to their relatively anonymous nature, cryptocurrencies are becoming an increasingly popular target for robberies.Back in December 2017, Cointelegraph covered another case: the managing director of the cryptocurrency exchange EXMO Pavel Lerner was kidnapped in Kiev by an group of unidentified people. Fortunately, Lerner got out safely just two days later, albeit having to pay a ransom of $1 mln in bitcoins.Another robbery has taken place in neighboring Russia in mid-January, in which a locally famous cryptocurrency blogger was deprived of $425,000 worth of bitcoins.

Fork Fail: US Government Institute Claims Bitcoin Cash Is ‘Original’ Bitcoin,William Suberg,2018-01-30 15:20:00,66819,778,"A US government institute has claimed Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is the “original” Bitcoin while Bitcoin itself (BTC) is a “fork” in a surprising official research into cryptocurrency.In a document titled “Blockchain Technology Overview” from the National Institute of Standards and Technology under the US Department of Commerce, authors Dylan Yaga, Peter Mell, Nik Roby and Karen Scarfone claim that “technically,” the perception that BTC is the genuine version of Bitcoin is incorrect.“When SegWit was activated, it caused a hard fork, and all the mining nodes and users who did not want to change started calling the original Bitcoin blockchain Bitcoin Cash (BCC),” they write.“Technically, Bitcoin is a fork and Bitcoin Cash is the original blockchain. When the hard fork occurred, people had access to the same amount of coins on Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.”The document makes for curious reading at a time when the cryptocurrency industry remains awash with propaganda and marketing activities from BCH and BTC representatives alike.Confusion for new users in Bitcoin has increased following July’s hard fork due to some major resources in the industry, notably Roger Ver’s Bitcoin.com, controversially allying with BCH.More recently, two scandals involving BCH, mainstream news outlet CNBC and major US exchange Coinbase further dented BCH’s reputation.The US government document nonetheless appears unfazed by both the events and the nature of Bitcoin’s hard fork itself, continuing on to provide descriptions of other cryptocurrencies.Litecoin, authors say, is a “complement to Bitcoin,” while Ethereum Classic is underlined as the original version of “more popular” Ethereum.Last Week, ratings agency Weiss also caused a stir when it delivered its first cryptocurrency ratings, giving Bitcoin a ‘C+’ and Ethereum a ‘B.’",41

Cooper implied the business, which has generated considerable controversy with its alleged offerings, does not in fact offer “banking services.”The release explains:“The Cease & Desist Order was based on the Commissioner’s finding that AriseBank violated Texas Finance Code Chapter 31 by using the term “bank” in its name and marketing materials to imply that it is in the business of banking in this state”“The order requires AriseBank to cease and desist from implying that they engage in the business of banking in Texas. AriseBank is further required to clearly disclose that they do not offer their services to consumers in Texas,” it continues.Arise came to prominence late last year when an alleged partnership with BitShares and a launch of an ICO were decried as a scam in cryptocurrency circles.Describing itself as “the first ever decentralized banking platform,” the project was led by Jared Rice, a figure who himself has attracted negative publicity for defrauding business partners according to complaints portal Ripoff Report.Arise’s ICO and partnership sparked a dedicated review of the website’s activities, researchers similarly concluding the business was a “total scam.”Earlier, Cointelegraph reported that the state of Texas had similarly ordered the now-defunct platform Bitconnect to cease and desist in the selling of unlicensed securities.According to the Texas order, Arise must now comply with the terms and adopt a 100% hands-off approach to Texas consumers by January 26, after failing to reply to the original order issued January 5.Cointelegraph was unable to verify the situation with AriseBank due to its website no longer functioning as of press time Monday.",3

Coincheck: Stolen $534 Mln NEM Were Stored On Low Security Hot Wallet,Jon Buck,2018-01-26 18:35:00,83561,786,"Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck, one of the largest in the country, was the victim of a massive hack resulting in a loss of 523 mln NEM coins, worth approximately $534 mln.The coins were stolen via several unauthorized transactions from a hot wallet at 3:00 am local time on Friday, Jan. 26.Following the hack, the Coincheck exchange has hosted a press conference to provide the details of what has happened and what’s coming next.The hack only involved NEM. No other cryptocurrencies, including Ripple (XRP), were stolen, contrary to the early reports covered by Cointelegraph.According to the exchange’s representatives, the hackers have managed to steal the private key for the hot wallet where NEM coins were stored, enabling them to drain the funds.All the stolen money belonged to the customers of the exchange. The ‘inappropriate’ movement of the funds was reported by Coincheck to Japan’s Financial Services Agency, as well as the police later on the same day.Shortly after the breach, the company halted all withdrawals from the site, hoping to stop any further damage to its funds. When asked whether they will begin allowing “at least” fiat currency withdrawals soon, Coincheck replied that that will be done after they have determined the best way to proceed.It has come to light that the funds were being stored on a simple hot wallet rather than a much more secure multisig wallet.Coincheck’s representatives have claimed that the security setup differs between various coins on the exchange.Other cryptocurrencies on the site are currently stored in multisig wallets, but the NEM was not. When pressed by the media, the company insisted that “security standards were not low,” however the lack of multisig protection for NEM may indicate the opposite.The company made clear that they use various wallet types for housing different assets. Specifically, Bitcoin and Ether are stored in cold storage wallets, with Bitcoin additionally having a multisig address. Ether, “given its nature,” is not stored on a multisig wallet.According to their statement, more than half of Coincheck’s 80 permanent employees work on systems development, including security.Going forward, Coincheck claimed that it knows the address where the stolen NEM is currently being stored by the hackers, and is hoping to be able to track the culprits.While the company cannot currently disclose how many users were affected, they have expressed a desire to refund all the money that was lost.When asked whether they are going to resume operations or will have to declare bankruptcy, Coincheck said that ‘in principle’ they plan to keep operating.While the exchange has expressed a desire to refund all lost funds, they nevertheless are still considering how to approach the situation. Per the press conference, the “worst-case scenario” would be that the funds can never be returned.When asked whether they have any words for the customers, Coincheck representatives have said that they “deeply regret” what happened.",22
Investors File Class Action Lawsuit Against Bitconnect Following Its Shutdown,Helen Partz,2018-01-25 16:40:00,75057,556,"Former BitConnect investors have filed a class action lawsuit Wednesday, Jan. 24, seeking compensation from the company that was found out to be a Ponzi scheme and has shut down on Jan. 17.The class action complaint states that BitConnect issued cryptocurrency tokens that were actually unregistered securities and collected additional funds via a ""wide-ranging Ponzi scheme.""The complaint has been filed by six individuals on their own behalf, as well as that of all other persons who have lost their money by investing into BitConnect. The six plaintiffs stated that their personal losses amounted to $771,000.It is alleged that BitConnect guaranteed a 40 percent monthly return that it promised to generate by trading the investors’ funds on the cryptocurrency market.Ultimately, the plaintiffs claim that instead of genuinely generating revenue via cryptocurrency trading, the platform actually used the funds from new investors to meet the expectations of the existing ones.Launched in February 2016, BitConnect was a cryptocurrency community platform which introduced its own cryptocurrency Bitconnect coin (BCC) in November 2016.According to data from Coinmarketcap, the BCC has reached the peak of its popularity in Dec. 2017, when its market capitalization hit about $2.7 bln.Just days later, on Jan. 4, the state of Texas issued a cease and desist order against BitConnect for the selling of unlicensed securities which has led to the crash of the BCC token and the platform’s closure.Meanwhile, BitConnect has managed to attract a different kind of attention by releasing a bizarre video from its annual ceremony in New York.In it, the company’s eccentric representative Carlos Matos claims that his own investment in BitConnect has paid off several times over. “My wife still doesn’t believe me,” said Matos, describing how rich he has become. ",18

He has been charged with two counts of wire fraud - for Bitcoin Store and Bar Works respectively - with each carrying a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.Haddow was taken into police custody in Tangiers last July after Interpol issued a warrant for his arrest. The warrant followed the SEC’s applications for final default judgements against three of Haddow’s schemes, ordering him to pay penalties in excess of $83 mln for securities fraud.Bitcoin Store was purportedly a crypto exchange, although the SEC alleged investor funds were diverted and the exchange never became “profitable”. Bar Works, meanwhile, illicitly leased co-working space services to investors around the world. The SEC alleged Haddow defrauded investors out of over $37 mln in total. In both schemes, Haddow is said to have concealed his involvement under false identities.Earlier this month, the SEC charged a fraudulent celebrity-endorsed ICO with illicitly raising $32 mln in unregistered investments.

These developments pose risks not only to finance, but to the country’s social order, it added.Reuters further reports this week that the prime minister ordered the State Bank of Vietnam to crack down on all crypto-related financial services, as well as urging the Ministry of Justice to complete a legal framework for the management of virtual currencies and assets.The move follows reports of what could be the largest crypto fraud in history if proven true, with allegations that Vietnam-based Modern Tech swindled 32,000 investors out of 15 trln dong ($658 mln) in an ICO involving sales of Ifan and Pincoin, two ECR-20 tokens.A lack of hard currency payouts prompted a demonstration outside Modern Tech’s Ho Chi Minh City headquarters on April 8. The cellphone of the company’s chief director, Ho Xuan Van, was switched off on April 11, according to Reuters.Le Dong Phong, the police chief of Ho Chin Minh City, said the authorities were waiting for alleged victims to file official accusations before launching an investigation.

Spanish Authorities Arrest 11 In Crypto Money Laundering Ring,Aaron Wood,2018-04-10 23:47:00,13609,209,"Operation Tulipan Blanca (White Tulip), coordinated by Europol and conducted by the Spanish Guardia Civil, has resulted in the arrest of 11 individuals for laundering more than EUR 8 mln via cryptocurrencies, according to a Europol press release April 9.According to Europol, the investigation was centered around a crime ring which launders money from narcotics sales using credit cards and cryptocurrencies.Launderers would pick up the illicit funds in cash, after which they would deposit them in small amounts into hundreds of third bank accounts. Since the cash was already circulating in the financial system, the ring just needed to transfer the illicit funds back to the drug dealers in Colombia. The criminals would then acquire credit cards linked with the accounts, and travel to Colombia where they would make withdrawals.Once the criminals realized that cash withdrawals and bank operations were easy to track, they used cryptocurrencies instead, mainly Bitcoin. The suspects converted illicit funds to Bitcoin through an exchange, which they then changed to Colombian pesos and deposited into Colombian bank accounts the same day.Through collaboration with Finnish authorities, police were able to establish that the exchange being used by the criminal ring was located in Finland, and collect the necessary information to track the culprits.137 individuals are still being investigated by the Guardia Civil. The investigation shows that the suspects deposited over EUR 8 mln into 174 different bank accounts. Europol says it has organized special training “to assist law enforcement officers in identifying the use of cryptocurrencies by organized crime networks.”Cointelegraph reported earlier today that the US Department of Justice (DoJ) seized backpage.com on charges that it laundered nearly half a billion dollars in illegal revenue, some via cryptocurrencies.",[]
"India: Police Officers Beat, Extorted 200 BTC From Businessman, Local Sources Say",Molly Jane Zuckerman,2018-04-10 18:25:00,15220,155,"The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) in Gujarat, India is investigating the alleged kidnapping and extortion of 200 Bitcoins (BTC) from a businessman by police, local news outlet India Today reported Monday, April 9.The CID has filed an FIR (police document that predates the beginning of a police investigation) against 10 police officers, including a superintendent of police (SP) and an inspector, for the alleged crime.Indian businessman and builder Sailesh Bhatt has alleged that on Feb. 9 Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) officer Sunil Nair first had him beaten, with the help of other cops, in a room at the CBI until he paid a ransom of around $770,000, not specifying in what kind of currency.Bhatt describes in the complaint how after he was released he was later kidnapped and taken to a farm where he was forced to send 200 BTC (worth around $2 mln at the time) to former business partner Kirit Paladiya:“They beat me up inside a room and threatened to kill me in a fake encounter if I did not hand over my Bitcoins [...] Amreli [city in Gunjarat] SP Jagdish Patel and Amreli inspector Anant Patel were involved. I was forced to transfer Rs 13 crore [around $2 mln] in Bitcoins to Paladiya's account.”Local news outlet News18’s coverage of the story writes that the BTC was sent from Paladiya’s wallet, a statement backed up by a quotation from Director General of Police (DGP) CID Ashish Bhatia that there is “no evidence yet of [B]itcoins worth Rs 12 crore [around $2 mln] being transferred from Shailesh Bhatt’s wallet or from the wallet of his business partner Kirit Padaliya.”Bhatt notes that Paladiya told him that he was under observance by the Indian economic law agency, the Enforcement Directorate, for dealing in BTC, after which he was called in for a meeting with Paladiya and then allegedly abducted in police vehicles. DGP Bhatia has confirmed that government vehicles were used in the abduction.Bhatt also alleges that Nalin Kotadiya, a former member of the political Gujarat Parivartan Party, was involved in that he pressured him to pay the ransom.Bhatia referred to the FIR complaint as “a case of abduction and extortion,” adding that they have “formed a SIT that will investigate all the aspects of this case.” Three of the officers reportedly involved have been arrested, and Inspector Patel has absconded.Different local news outlets have reported the amount of allegedly stolen BTC differently, ranging from $1.8 mln to $2 mln, most likely due to the daily volatility of BTC’s price.Cases of abductions of cryptocurrency holders for ransom have become more common in the past year, notably in the former Soviet Union. In December 2017, a Bitcoin crypto exchange executive in Ukraine was kidnapped and forced to pay more than $1 mln in BTC as ransom; in January of this year, a Russian blogger who had boasted online of his crypto wealth was beaten and robbed of around $425,00 in fiat; in early February, a man in Moscow was attacked with a knife and forced to send over $1 mln in crypto to his attackers; and in late February, a crypto developer, also in Moscow, was beaten and robbed over over $3 mln in BTC.",[]

If the claim is proven true, the scam would be the largest in the crypto industry to date.Modern Tech had said it was only an official representative of both coins in Vietnam, before media reports confirmed its seven Vietnamese executives were in fact the masterminds behind them.According to local news outlet Viet Bao, the owner of Modern Tech’s office building said the company had moved out a month prior in early March.“Modern Tech left and liquidated a contract about one month ago,” the publication quotes the firm as saying. “No one knows where they are located now.”Pincoin had been under suspicion online for months. Financial scam directory Behindmlm released an analysis in February 2018 that noted its buy-in method and opaque nature were characteristic of an “ROI ponzi.”The scheme’s website remains online, along with Ifan’s, which masqueraded as a bridge between celebrities and their fans.",[]
Nano Foundation Sponsors Legal Fund To Provide BitGrail Hack Victims With Representation,Ana Alexandre,2018-04-10 01:07:00,17448,228,"The Nano Foundation has announced it will sponsor a legal fund to provide all victims of the hack of cryptocurrency exchange BitGrail with equal access to representation and pursue their legal interests associated with BitGrail’s insolvency, according to a Nano Foundation blog post April 9.In February, the Italy-based digital currency exchange BitGrail suffered a loss of one of its hosted tokens, Nano, and afterwards froze trading. The trading platform claimed that 17 mln Nano had been stolen in the hack, amounting to about $187 mln at the time the losses were detected.To ensure all victims would receive proper legal support and have a chance to recover their assets, the Nano team reportedly contacted Espen Enger at the end of February to launch a legal fund. At the time Enger represented the interests of almost 600 BitGrail hack victims . Shortly after, the Nano team also contacted the Italian law firm of Bonelli Erede, which collaborated with Mr. Enger. Nano Foundation stated in the announcement:“As a result, we are announcing today that Nano will be matching the contributions of the victims to the legal fund established by Mr. Enger — including both past and future donations, for up to $1 mln — with a goal of establishing a total legal fund valued at $2 mln.”According to the blog post, the victims represented by Espen Enger have managed to raise more than $300,000 in different currencies, including over 53,000 Nano, on their own. With the donation from the Nano Foundation, the sum will double to a value of over $600,000. The company claims that outside of making donations, the foundation will not have any access to or control over the funds.The Nano Foundation stated in the announcement that all reliable evidence they had reviewed “continues to point to a bug in BitGrail’s exchange software as the reason for the loss of funds.” Meanwhile, BitGrail denies the responsibility for the security breach, insisting the fault lies in Nano’s software.Last week a class action lawsuit was filed at the US District Court Eastern District of New York on behalf of Nano investors. The lawsuit alleges that Nano violated US securities regulations in addition to misrepresenting the reliability of the BitGrail exchange. The suit asks that the court compel Nano to “rescue fork” the missing Nano into a new cryptocurrency that would fairly compensate the victims of the hack.",[]

Farkas had made arrangements to leave the country, but was detained before boarding his flight.According to the SEC, Sharma and Farkas claimed the company would offer a variety of financial products, including a debit card backed by Visa and MasterCard, with which users could instantly convert cryptocurrencies into US dollars and other legal tender. The SEC says that no such agreement or relationship existed between Centra Tech. Inc. and Visa or Mastercard.The US financial watchdog further alleges that Sharma and Farkas promoted their fraudulent ICO by creating fictional executives with impressive resumes and biographies, posting “false or misleading” market materials, in addition to paying celebrities to promote the ICO. American boxer Floyd Mayweather supported the ICO on Instagram in a post which has since been removed. Stephanie Avakian, the Co-Director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement said of the charges:""We allege that Centra sold investors on the promise of new digital technologies by using a sophisticated marketing campaign to spin a web of lies about their supposed partnerships with legitimate businesses.

The malware provided the alleged perpetrators with control over affected hardware, allowing them to compromise ATMs and use the machines to withdraw unlimited sums of money.AP reports that the cybercriminals didn’t spend the ill-obtained cash but instead exchanged it into bitcoins.

Out of the 149 cases of “unauthorized access” to crypto accounts, in about 80 percent of cases (122 cases) the wallets did not use “two-factor authentication,” only using ID and password, Nikkei reports.The currencies that make up the largest percentage of the hack are Bitcoin (BTC) (85 BTC lost), Ripple (XRP) (55 XRP), with 13 other altcoins included as well.By NPA data, the number of hacks increased per month as BTC’s price increased -- 9 unauthorized attempts in April 2017, 19 in May, and 41 in June. There were 425 cases of illegal online transfers of fiat currencies, which is less than ¼ of the amount noted by the NPA in 2014.After the Jan.

Canadian Bitcoin Entrepreneur Slams BCH As ‘Scam’ During Parliamentary Testimony,Molly Jane Zuckerman,2018-03-20 16:50:00,33068,282,"Bitcoin (BTC) tech entrepreneur Jonathan Hamel appeared in front of Canada’s House of Commons Standard Committee on Finance yesterday, March 19, and declared: “Pay close attention, other cryptocurrencies are downright scams, like BCash [Bitcoin Cash (BCH)].”Hamel first posted on Twitter about his upcoming testimony during a Parliamentary cryptocurrency discussion, without mentioning BCH:I will appear today before the @OurCommons Standing Committee on Finance to explain how Canada became a leader in the Bitcoin industry and why excessive regulation could slow down innovation in the Blockchain space https://t.co/QZkoWVi63xHowever, Hamel had then posted on Reddit prior to giving the crypto testimony, writing, “Spoiler: I'm gonna say ‘Bcash is a scam’ and it's gonna be archived forever in the Parliamentary records (not a blockchain but still...) Donations are welcome,” followed by a crypto wallet address and a picture of his Bitcoin patterned socks.Hamel’s Reddit comment sparked backlash in the Reddit community, with some users seeing his inclusion of an, albeit attempting to be humorous, request for donations as crossing an ethical line. Reddit user TheGreatMuffin wrote,“Asking for donations for a statement you made while a government hearing is kinda undermining the expertise of your whole talk, in the eyes of the listeners and media.. You are aware you are out in public here?I appreciate straightforwardness but asking for donations on a public forum for a statement made on a governmental hearing is really not smart at all.”The debate between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, a well-known fork that took place in August 2017 and is touted by crypto personas like Roger Ver, came to a head in late February when BTC transaction fees dipped below the price of BCH -- lower transaction fees being one of BCH’s reported main advantages over BTC.Reddit user ambivalentasf*** added a perspective about the BTC v. BCH debate to the previous Reddit comments:“Not to mention the fact that in terms of any governing body trying to distinguish between legitimate tech and true scams, Bcash does not clearly distinguish itself as a 'scam' while leaving Bitcoin legit. Both Bitcoin and Bcash are susceptible to influence by bad actors with enough capital to create a wake. So while assumptions being made about the motivations of actors like Roger Ver might be correct, if you seek to have the government recognize a forked chain of Bitcoin as a scam, how do you anticipate they are going to evaluate the parent technology from which Bcash forked?The point is there is nothing inherent to Bcash protocol that makes it a ‘scam’ while Bitcoin is not.”",12

We can trade in that. Why do people want bitcoin? For secrecy,” he said.Stiglitz was joined by Swiss National Bank chairman Thomas Jordan, who in a speech also argued for tough restrictions on how Bitcoin can be used.“There is an important principle: Similar activities should be similarly regulated,” he told listeners, “and Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have some characteristics of other investment instruments.”“You can’t, on the one hand, heavily restrict cash and on the other hand permit fully anonymous instruments that to a great extent can be used for all manner of transactions.”The WEF has traditionally brought together proponents, opponents and fence-sitters on Bitcoin and Blockchain technology, with Cointelegraph in attendance at this year’s event.While cryptocurrency markets continue in a bearish cycle this month, Bitcoin price forecasts have become decidedly more down to earth, while outright critics have also softened their stance.Fellow Nobel Prize winning economist Robert Shiller, who in September 2017 described Bitcoin as “the best example of a bubble,” went on record last week to say he “doesn’t know what to make of Bitcoin ultimately.”",58

In essence, one needed to send Bitconnect Bitcoin in exchange for Bitconnect Coin (BCC) on their exchange.Once you had BCC, you were guaranteed “up to 120 percent return per year.” Users were told they were earning interest by holding their coin “for helping maintain the security of the network.”Source: Bitconnect.coBitconnect’s lending platform is what really led to accusations of a Ponzi scheme, as well as cease and desist orders from regulators.Source: Bitconnect.coAs the above illustration explains, users bought BCC with Bitcoin and then lent out their BCC on the Bitconnect lending software.Users would receive varying percentages of interest depending on the amount of BCC they had lent.Source: Bitconnect.coAdd in the referral system seen in many other Ponzi schemes and the fact that the operation was run anonymously; it's hardly surprising that this whole endeavor has ended in tears.The lending scheme was the main draw card of Bitconnect because of its huge promise of returns. In order to participate in the scheme, you had to buy BCC - which saw the token hit an all-time high of $437.31 per BCC before it plummeted in value following the closure this week.That being said, the cryptocurrency is still alive and trading at around $35 at the time of writing.Following Bitconnect’s closure, social media was abuzz with sentiments of ‘I told you so.’TenX co-founder Julian Hosp highlighted the fact that BCC was still trading as a real head-scratcher.Everything that's wrong with crypto in one picture! #bitconnect #scam #ponzi #cryptocurrencies #bubble pic.twitter.com/t5o9Nm1rZ4Francis Pouliot shared a hilarious video of a Bitconnect meet which had been slightly dubbed over.People invested billions of dollars in this(This video is actually hilarious recommended for memephiles) https://t.co/Jpb8xpJsx7American cartoonist Spike Trotman shared one of the most entertaining and eerily accurate predictions back in September 2017, postulating that Bitconnect was indeed a Ponzi scheme.Her latest tweet is a screenshot of the Bitconnect Reddit page, with subreddits for a suicide hotline as well as a massive legal action megathread.

Russia: Blogger Who ‘Boasted’ About Crypto Wealth Beaten and Robbed For $425k,William Suberg,2018-01-15 22:35:00,91466,517,"A Russian cryptocurrency investor and blogger known online as Pavel Nyashin was attacked and robbed in his home in Leningrad Oblast the night of Jan. 14. The assailants stole funds worth 24 mln rubles ($425,000), according to local media.Nyashin was tied and beaten while a group of masked assailants stole a safe containing cash and “essential documents.”Nyashin, a self-made millionaire from cryptocurrency investing, had “boasted” about his wealth online and at meetings of well-known bloggers he attended, local media network NTV reports.The crypto blogger told NTV in a video interview:“They took the safe in the end, as they knew there was cash in the house. In it was a sum equivalent to 24 mln rubles, as well as a lot of essential documents.”The 23-year-old Nyashin from St. Petersburg had previously made known about his successes online while advising on how to become rich from cryptocurrency, according to NTV, which ran an admonitory headline “Millionaire blogger beaten and robbed for boasting.” According to Russian-language cryptocurrency news outlet ForkLog, Nyashin is the founder of the YouTube channel on crypto trading that has almost 15,000 subscribers.ForkLog also reported that the “bandits” destroyed all electronic equipment in Nyashin’s home and fled the scene in what appeared to be a Mercedes.NTV adds that the assailants further removed a laptop he used to trade on exchanges. Nyashin himself has yet to find out if his accounts have been hacked and assess the full damage done.A criminal case has been opened on the armed assault, NTV reports.Cointelegraph previously reported on the fate of EXMO exchange CEO Pavel Lerner, who was kidnapped in the Ukrainian capital Kiev and only released on payment of a $1 mln ransom late last month.Prior to that, Ukrainian security personnel allegedly tried to steal funds from Anatoly Kaplan, founder and CEO of ForkLog, in a raid of his place of residence, as well as of the ForkLog office, in Odessa.",17
"Hardware Bitcoin Wallets Not Vulnerable to Spectre Attacks, Funds Safe",Joseph Young,2018-01-05 02:55:00,68680,529,"Trezor and Ledger, two of the most widely utilized cryptocurrency hardware wallets, have reaffirmed that the recently discovered vulnerabilities on CPUs and the latest Spectre attacks have not affected hardware cryptocurrency wallets.As Cointelegraph previously reported, Pavol Rusnak, the chief technical officer at Satoshi Labs, the parent company of Trezor, wrote:“As more people are asking: @TREZOR is not vulnerable to recent Meltdown and Spectre hardware attacks, because it has processor not affected by these. Also our firmware is always signed, so the device never runs untrusted code. Using a hardware wallet is now more important than ever.”Rusnak emphasized that users should rely on hardware wallets at this specific period of time, because Spectre attacks have drastically impacted the cloud services on which many cryptocurrency exchanges and wallet platforms operate. Earlier today, several cryptocurrency exchanges including Bittrex were taken offline due to the vulnerabilities found in Intel CPUs. These weaknesses affected Azure cloud services offered by Microsoft, and by extension, the exchanges hosted on Azure.New York Times cybersecurity journalist Nicole Perlroth wrote:“Meltdown and Spectre show that it is possible for attackers to exploit these design flaws to access the entire memory contents of a machine. The most visceral attack scenario is an attacker who rents 5 minutes of time from an Amazon or Google or Microsoft cloud server and steals data from other customers renting space on that same cloud server.”Hardware cryptocurrency wallet developers and Bitcoin experts have recommended users to move their funds from centralized online platforms to hardware wallets. Jonas Schnelli, a Bitcoin Core developer, stated:“The current privileged memory side channel attacks just confirms what many Bitcoin users already know. Don't trust your PC. Don't think applications (and private keys) are shielded. Use a hardware wallet.”Unlike exchanges, hardware wallets are non-custodial wallets that allow users to remain in full control over their private keys. When users initialize their hardware wallet, they write down 12 - 24 words which comprise a backup for their seed. With this backup, even if the wallet platform gets hacked, users can obtain their funds and move them to another wallet or paper wallets.But centralized trading platforms and wallets store private keys on behalf of their users. The result is a centralization of private keys, creating a significant security issue.The Ledger development team released a detailed blog post as to why hardware cryptocurrency wallets are not at risk due to Intel, AMD and ARM CPU vulnerabilities. The company wrote:“Ledger’s devices are not affected by these attacks. First of all, to exploit these flaws, the attacker has to be able to run arbitrary code. As long as you only use Ledger’s embedded apps (which is strongly recommended), your Nano S / Blue is not vulnerable to these kind of attacks.”Most importantly, because any modern machine is affected by the Spectre vulnerabilities, it would be wise not to use Wi-Fi while sending and receiving cryptocurrencies.",5
"Two New Hardware Bugs Affect Most Devices, Private Keys Vulnerable",William Suberg,2018-01-04 20:40:00,67930,522,"Researchers have published a report on two hardware bugs that allow programs to steal sensitive data on affected devices, which is “most” devices worldwide.For crypto users, these bugs are a direct threat to the security of their private keys, making the need for secure hardware storage of crypto funds even more pressing.The two bugs, known as Meltdown and Spectre, exploit security vulnerabilities in Intel, AMD, and ARM processors in any device, including PCs, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.Meltdown affects all devices with Intel chips, which are estimated to be in 90% of all computers (desktop and laptop combined), the BBC reported.Spectre potentially has an even wider reach, affecting Intel, ARM, and AMD chips in any kind of device. Meltdown and Spectre also work in the cloud.The BBC also reported that the tech industry kept the threat a secret for up to six months via non-disclosure agreements, but now fears are mounting that public awareness could lead to real-life exploits.Bitcoin core developer Jonas Schnelli referred to the newly reported security flaws in terms of how they affect Bitcoin users, laying out three steps to secure cryptocurrency holdings:The current privileged memory side channel attacks just confirms what many Bitcoin users already ""know"" (feel):* Don't trust your PC.* Don't think applications (and private keys) are shielded* Use a hardware walletBackground:https://t.co/0avUWC44oyhttps://t.co/pw0cLDWyZePavol Rusnak, the CTO of TREZOR manufacturer SatoshiLabs, tweeted Jan. 4 to confirm that its devices are unaffected by Meltdown and Spectre, noting:“Using a (hardware) wallet is now more important than ever.”As more people are asking: @TREZOR is not vulnerable to recent Meltdown and Spectre hardware attacks, because it has processor not affected by these.

FT: EXMO Director Released From Kidnap After Paying $1 Mln Ransom,Olivia Capozzalo,2017-12-29 22:00:00,42867,271,"Pavel Lerner, the managing director of the cryptocurrency exchange EXMO kidnapped in Kiev Dec. 27, was released today after paying a $1 mln ransom in Bitcoin, The Financial Times (FT) reports.Lerner was abducted in Kiev on Wednesday leaving his office. Ukrainian online publication Strana.ua was first to report that he was taken away by “unknown persons” in a black Mercedes Benz.FT reports they were informed of the ransom payment by Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian interior minister. Gerashchenko told FT:“He was kidnapped by an armed gang for the purpose of extorting Bitcoins. We have operative information that he paid more than $1 mln worth of Bitcoins.”In an article published today, Strana.ua reported that sources in the local police believe the kidnappers were frightened into releasing Lerner after the story of his abduction garnered so much attention globally.Today EXMO released an official statement about Lerner’s abduction. The statement reports that the company “got a hold” of Lerner today and that he is currently safe:“At the moment, he is safe, and there was no physical harm inflicted on him. Nevertheless, Pavel is currently in a state of major stress; therefore, he will not provide any official comments in the coming days.”The EXMO statement contains no mention of a ransom paid of any amount. In the statement, the exchange repeated that Lerner’s abduction in no way affected the company’s usual functioning:“We would also like to point out that Pavel’s activity at EXMO did not involve an access to financial assets of our users. Despite the aforementioned, the platform continues its usual operations.”However, according to the company’s official Twitter, the exchange was under DDoS attack just yesterday, Dec. 28.EXMO is under the DDoS attack.The site will be available within half an hour.We apologize for the temporary inconvenience.Sincerely, The EXMO TeamAccording to Strana.ua, Lerner is a Russian citizen who holds a residence permit in Poland and is involved in a number of crypto/ Blockchain startups in Ukraine. FT reports that EXMO is officially registered in the UK, but has “operations in Ukraine.”As per EXMO’s official statement today, the investigation into Lerner’s abduction continues and the identities of the kidnappers are still unknown. Once identified, the perpetrators could face up to five years imprisonment, in accordance with article 146.2 of the Ukrainian criminal code, which covers abduction for “mercenary purposes” or by a group of people “upon their prior conspiracy.”",2
"South Korean Government Concerned With Scams in Bitcoin Market, Fake Exchanges",Joseph Young,2017-12-25 18:27:00,38426,309,"The South Korean government and local financial authorities have warned investors about the emergence of fake cryptocurrency and Bitcoin exchanges.On Dec. 13, the South Korean government and its cryptocurrency task force formed by the Ministry of Strategy and Finance, Financial Services Commission, Ministry of Justice, Fair Trade Commission and Financial Supervisory Commission held an emergency meeting to discuss the state of the South Korean cryptocurrency market and draft regulations for both businesses and investors.Two of the four regulations drafted by the South Korean government during the emergency meeting were:Given the rapidly increasing number of fraudulent cryptocurrency exchanges, platforms and activities, the South Korean government urgently moved to regulating cryptocurrency exchanges and cracking down on fraudulent operations.Last week, several fake cryptocurrency exchanges were exposed by the local Bitcoin community and financial authorities. One of the fake exchanges was BitKRX, named after Korea Exchange (KRX), the largest financial trading platform in South Korea established by KOSDAQ, South Korea Futures Exchange and South Korea Stock Exchange.The BitKRX exchange marketed itself as a branch of KRX, coaxing users into its platform by promoting its businesses as a regulated and legitimate venture led created by KRX.Chosun, one of South Korea’s largest mainstream media outlets, reported that local financial authorities and law enforcement have begun to crackdown on cryptocurrency exchanges with deceptive marketing and fraudulent operations. Specifically, local financial authorities disclosed that several cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea are unregulated but are operating as legitimate businesses by utilizing the branding of leading financial institutions, like BitKRX.One member of the South Korean Bitcoin community told Chosun:“A small group of individuals that are not qualified and experienced enough to run high-traffic and large-scale platforms are running cryptocurrency exchanges in the local market. Consequently, traders are not able to properly execute buy and sell orders in a timely manner, causing major losses and difficulties for investors. Strict regulation of the market by the South Korean market will further stabilize the local cryptocurrency market.”Earlier this week, South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchange Bithumb, which is also the second largest trading platform in the global cryptocurrency market, stated that a right set of regulations for businesses and investors would nurture the cryptocurrency market and facilitate its exponential growth. Bithumb said:”A right set of regulations will rather nurture the (virtual currency) market, and we would welcome that.”For cryptocurrency exchanges like Bithumb, Korbit and Coinone, that process billions of dollars in trades on a daily basis, regulations are necessary because a rather large portion of investors in the South Korean cryptocurrency market are falling victim to Ponzi schemes and scams.This month, a $200 mln cryptocurrency-inspired Ponzi scheme was unraveled by the local law enforcement. 14 individuals of MiningMax, a cloud mining Ponzi scheme, were arrested by South Korean police with several charges, including economic crime and fraud.According to cryptocurrency market data provider CryptoCompare, the South Korean cryptocurrency exchange market only accounts for 4.6 percent of the global cryptocurrency exchange market, behind the US, Japan and Europe.A $200 mln Ponzi scheme in a relatively small market can be avoided if investors directly trade cryptocurrencies on regulated platforms and exchanges.",8
North Korea Accused of Hacking South Korean Bitcoin Exchange Youbit,Joseph Young,2017-12-21 23:15:00,44575,331,"Earlier this week, major South Korean Bitcoin exchange Youbit suffered a large-scale security breach that led to the theft of one fifth of user funds.Almost immediately after the hacking attack, Youbit’s parent company Yapian filed for bankruptcy. In an official statement, the Youbit team told its users that 75 percent of their holdings on the Youbit exchange will be accessible and ready for withdrawal. But, to claim the rest of the funds, the company stated that investors will have to wait until the final settlement of bankruptcy proceedings.In the case of the now-defunct Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, which once was the largest Bitcoin exchange within the global cryptocurrency market, the settlement of bankrupt proceedings have taken more than four years. Still, the creditors of Mt. Gox have not received their funds and the procedure is still ongoing.Unfortunately, for Youbit investors, it may take several months to years to receive the remaining 25 percent of their personal funds, as the settlement of bankruptcy proceedings will have to be finalized before the company can credit its customers.Upon the discovery of the hacking attack, the Youbit team told its clients that the company is working closely with local authorities and the South Korean law enforcement to evaluate and investigate the security breach. The Youbit team said:“Currently, we are cooperating with law enforcement and third-party investigators to evaluate the breach. We are trying everything in our capability to minimize the losses of our users and we are considering several ways to handle this situation. We would like to apologize again for disappointing our users.”According to the Wall Street Journal, sources familiar with the ongoing investigation into the Youbit security breach have discovered telltale signs and historical evidence that North Korean state-funded hackers likely engaged and initiated the hacking attack.In September 2017, security research firm FireEye revealed in a threat research paper that it has found evidence to link various cryptocurrency exchange hacking attacks to North Korea by analyzing the tools that were used to hack into South Korean cryptocurrency platforms.One of the methods used by the North Korean hacking group was Spear Phishing, the FireEye report stated, which targeted individual cryptocurrency users with highly sophisticated phishing attacks and malware. FireEye further emphasized that there is some evidence to link previous South Korean cryptocurrency exchange security breaches to North Korea.Specifically, the FireEye team wrote that the following activities were likely initiated by North Korean hackers:Given the imposition of harsh international sanctions against North Korea by the US government and the financial instability of the North Korean regime, FireEye researchers wrote that North Korean hackers have had many incentives to target South Korean exchanges. The report read:“While Bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchanges may seem like odd targets for nation-state actors interested in funding state coffers, some of the other illicit endeavors North Korea pursues further demonstrate an interest in conducting financial crime on the regime’s behalf. North Korea's Office 39 is involved in activities such as gold smuggling, counterfeiting foreign currency, and even operating restaurants.”In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Troy Stangarone, a senior director at the Korea Economic Institute, shared a similar sentiment with FireEye and stated that North Korea is in an ideal position to target Bitcoin companies as it has to find ways to earn back money from the recently imposed sanctions. Stangarone said:“North Korea is an ideal country to use hacking and financial tools like Bitcoin. They’re experimenting with ways to earn back lost money from sanctions.”Throughout the upcoming weeks, the South Korean law enforcement and cybersecurity agencies are expected to focus on finding solid evidence to link the hacking attack targeted at Youbit to North Korean hackers.",6
"South Korea: Five Local Bitcoin Exchanges Fail Security Test, Hacked With ‘Basic Tools’",William Suberg,2017-12-21 21:05:00,39750,387,"South Korean media outlet MBC has hired a security firm to test the security setup of “five Korean Bitcoin exchanges,” including Bithumb. The company has allegedly been able to successfully hack into all five of the targeted platforms, receiving access to user data and funds.As the network reports in an article, it published about its own exploits today, ‘hackers’ it hired circumvented security procedures using what it describes as “basic hacking tools.”If true, the test underlines the fragmented nature of many users’ cryptocurrency exchange security settings, as well as the setups of exchanges themselves, as larger thefts continue to occur.Just this week, South Korean exchange Youbit announced it was filing for bankruptcy after suffering two hacks this year, the second of which lost it 17 percent of its net assets.It is unknown whether Youbit was one of the five exchanges targeted in MBC’s experiment, which saw security workers set up their own accounts which they then compromised. However, it is claimed that the country’s biggest exchange - Bithumb - was successfully hacked during the test.Bithumb has itself fallen victim to major security breaches in recent months, malicious parties gaining access to both funds and sensitive user account data.As part of the hacking, MBC’s proxies gained “user IDs and passwords” and even circumvented two-factor authentication.“The wallet was penetrated without difficulty,” the article relates. “The key to your wallet, ID and password was exposed.”Various theories have surfaced regarding South Korea’s exchange hacking issues, with North Korea increasingly suspected as a major perpetrator of cybercrime in order to amass cryptocurrency.According to the report, MBC has “contacted the South Korean government” prior to publishing, to notify it about the critical security issues on the local exchanges. Official responses have yet to emerge about the MBC investigation.",5
Crypto Exchange EtherDelta Warns Users of “Malicious Attacks”,Joshua Althauser,2017-12-21 15:07:00,22197,229,"Yesterday evening, cryptocurrency exchange EtherDelta sent out a series of tweets warning its users not to use the site. EtherDelta is reporting that they believe their DNS server has been compromised by a hack, and the unknown assailant has created a duplicate of the exchange’s domain.Their first warning tweet in the series reads:Dear users, we have reason to believe that there had been malicious attacks that temporarily gained access to @etherdelta https://t.co/NnqU5Er4rj DNS server. We are investigating this issue right now - in the meantime please DONOT use the current site.They described the phishing site to be a copy of their own site, but without the chat button on the navigation bar, nor the company’s official Twitter feed. It also holds fake order books.⚠️ 2/2 *BE AWARE* The imposer's app has no CHAT button on the navigation bar nor the offical Twitter Feed on the bottom right. It is also populated with a fake order book.Following the attack, the cryptocurrency exchange suspended services in the interest of safety. In the meanwhile, the alleged attacker’s Ether wallet has been flooded with warning comments from conscientious EtherDelta users.The appeal of cryptocurrency is largely due to its decentralization and the freedom and anonymity that comes with it. But this lack of centralized and transparent authority does come with a price -- there’s often very little recourse in hacks, such as this one.As the cryptocurrency market grows, more and more crypto-related services are experiencing attacks and proving vulnerable to them. Youbit, an exchange based in South Korea, recently had to declare bankruptcy after losing 17 percent of its net assets to several hacks, the first one taking place in April and losing a crippling 4,000 BTC.Mining service NiceHash lost 4,700 BTC in a hack early December, which would be worth almost $80 mln today. Reports also point to North Korea for staging hacking attempts aimed at multiple exchanges in South Korea by using fake job offers and Facebook profiles to gain access to cryptocurrency exchanges.Similar phishing attempts were made by a Twitter account that was spoofing OmiseGO while the team was announcing a possible AirDrop.Meanwhile, the EtherDelta team has been doing their best to limit the attack by providing their users with a video showing them how to safely transfer their funds without opening the site.",7
"Fearing Ransomware Attacks, Companies Preemptively Buying Bitcoin",Gareth Jenkinson,2017-12-20 21:55:00,27413,334,"While they are not common, cyber attacks have had crippling effects on various companies around the world.Financial institutions, corporations and government departments have all be targeted over the years. Recently, attackers began using ransomware which encrypts users’ computers until the victim pays a ransom to unlock their systems. Hackers usually demand payment in Bitcoin, because of its pseudo-anonymous nature.A piece of ransomware called Wannacry was probably the most damaging ransomware used this year. Wannacry targeted a number of government operations and companies around the world. Some have even theorized that Wannacry was intended to discredit Bitcoin, by associating the currency with criminal acts. The biggest target was the United Kingdom’s National Health Service, which was hit by multiple ransomware hacks earlier this year.With cybercriminals brazen enough to attack governmental institutions, it is unsurprising to hear that big companies are preparing themselves for future attacks. American corporations have been purchasing Bitcoin for a while, so they can quickly pay if they get hit by a ransomware attack.You could call it insurance. As reported on RT, KPMG’s head of cybersecurity, Paul Taylor, says some companies are planning for the worst by purchasing Bitcoin:“Companies are definitely stockpiling Bitcoin in order to be prepared to pay ransoms.”While the move is understandable given the havok a cyber attack can have, McAfee chief scientist Raj Samani believes it is a catch 22 situation:“It’s not something that organizations have publicly confirmed, because it says, ‘We are willing to pay criminals in the event we are hit by ransomware. However, it is certainly a practice we are aware [of].”It's not hard to understand why hackers are eager to receive ransom payments in Bitcoin. Not only is the currency pseudo-anonymous, but it has enjoyed a massive bull run this year. Spurred on by the launch of Bitcoin futures on Chicago-based exchanges CBOE and CME, the price of Bitcoin hit a high of $20,000 this week.Companies like Spanish telecoms giant Telefonica paid over $600,000 to unlock files encrypted by ransomware in May.",3
"NK ‘Absolutely Amassing’ Bitcoin, South Korean Exchange Bankrupted By Hack",William Suberg,2017-12-20 21:45:00,24882,209,"CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz has told mainstream media that North Korea is “absolutely” stockpiling Bitcoin to launch cyber attacks.Speaking to CNBC amid a flurry of reports the rogue state is using cryptocurrency to launch attacks on South Korea in particular, cybersecurity expert Kurtz said there was no need to doubt that it is “amassing” Bitcoin via theft.“I certainly think it highlights the capabilities that North Korea has in cyber… It’s something a lot of companies should be concerned about, particularly those companies that are dealing in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies,” he said.Crowdstrike CEO on 2018 cyber threat outlook from CNBC. North Korea’s propensity to steal Bitcoin from South Korean exchanges has become a common narrative as exchanges across the country report hacks this year.Notably, leading exchange Bithumb saw funds disappear en masse in July, while this week, smaller exchange Youbit filed for bankruptcy due to a hack which lost it 17 percent of its assets. That hack is now being attributed to North Korea.“They're building a cache of Bitcoin, if you think about it. It's an anonymous currency, it can easily bypass any sort of sanctions because there are none on Bitcoin, and the value has increased dramatically,” Kurtz continued.“It's the perfect currency for North Korea to be hoarding.”The US government has recently said that the NK was the perpetrator of this year’s WannaCry cyberattack which paralyzed major businesses across the world with Bitcoin ransomware.",6
Video Websites Used For Mining By Hackers,Gareth Jenkinson,2017-12-15 15:45:00,20618,235,"In the past, the likes of torrent website PirateBay has grabbed headlines for mining cryptocurrencies with users hardware.Adguard, makers of privacy and ad-blocking software, estimate that over a billion users have had malicious software installed on their computers, which is using processing power to mine cryptocurrency Monero.According to RT, website Openload, Streamango, Rapidvideo and OnlineVideoConverter have been accused of mining cryptocurrencies while users watch videos.By installing software on a user’s computer, the websites allow cybercriminals to mine Monero.Adguard Co-founder Andrey Meshkov said they discovered the activity using their software:“We came across several very popular websites that secretly use the resources of users’ devices for cryptocurrency mining. According to SimilarWeb, these four sites register 992 million visits monthly.”According to Meshkov, a massive amount of Monero has been mined in a very short space of time.“The total monthly earnings from crypto-jacking, taking into account the current Monero rate, could be as much as $326,000. These are simply outrageous figures.”While Bitcoin is the most valuable cryptocurrency, it’s almost useless to try and mine the virtual currency without specialized hardware.Malwarebytes’ Pieter Arntz says Monero is much easier to mine, making it the go-to currency for crypto jackers.“Monero mining does not depend on heavily specialized, application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), but can be done with any CPU or GPU. Without ASICs, it is almost pointless for an ordinary computer to participate in the mining process for Bitcoin.”If you suspect your PC is being used to mine cryptocurrency - check out our guide.",3
US ISIS Supporter Caught Sending $150k In Laundered Crypto To Syria,William Suberg,2017-12-15 14:00:00,56258,497,"Long Island, New York: a woman is facing up to 110 years in jail after trying to send $150,000 in Bitcoin and altcoins to ISIS.The New York Post reported how Zoobia Shahnaz fooled banks into giving her loans and credit cards, which she then used to purchase cryptocurrencies. The loan Shahnaz secured amounted to $22,500, while several credit cards contributed to a further $62,000 in cryptocurrency sent abroad to support the terrorist organization.Shahnaz, a US citizen, previously worked as a lab technician in a Manhattan hospital. Last year she traveled to Jordan to work with the Syrian American Medical Society as a volunteer medic in Syrian refugee camps where, according to court documents, ISIS had “significant influence.”In July of this year, the ISIS supporter was stopped and questioned in JFK Airport, apparently on her way to Syria and prevented from boarding. She was then arrested this Wednesday and charged with bank fraud and multiple counts of money laundering, Acting​ ​US Attorney Bridget Rohde said in a statement from the Department of Justice (DOJ) on Thursday.The DOJ outlined Shahnaz’s activities as follows:“...The defendant defrauded numerous financial institutions and obtained over $85,000 in illicit proceeds, which she converted to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. She then laundered and transferred the funds out of the country to support the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham [ISIS]”The same statement claims that Shahnaz was prevented from accomplishing her goals in supporting ISIS, though to what extent remains unclear. In the statement, the FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge William F. Sweeney triumphantly stated:“The FBI New York Joint Terrorism Task Force kept this woman from her dangerous and potentially deadly goal. We will do all we can to stop the next person hoping to do the same.” According to the statement, if convicted, Shahnaz faces a maximum of 30 years for the bank fraud charge and 20 years on each money laundering count.The events are a blow to Bitcoin proponents, who have been trying to defend the cryptocurrency’s reputation from its birth. Bitcoin skeptics regularly claim that the cryptocurrency enables illicit activities, including money laundering and support of terrorism.In terms of terrorism, analysts have found that cryptocurrency does not play a major role in funding terrorist organizations. However, Shahnaz’s case, though isolated, certainly works against cryptocurrency’s reputation.Following the attacks in Europe this Summer, the European Union is seeking to understand the extent to which crypto is implicated in financing terrorist groups, and potentially to decrease the anonymity of cryptocurrency transactions as much as possible.",14
"Bitcoin Platinum Created By South Korean Teenager As a Scam, Local Market Erupts",Joseph Young,2017-12-10 16:40:00,75863,208,"According to JoongAng, South Korea’s largest mainstream media outlet, investors in the local cryptocurrency exchange market are outraged over Bitcoin Platinum, an alleged scam created by a South Korean teenager.The Twitter handle @bitcoinplatinum, the official account of the Bitcoin Platinum project has advertised the project, as a hard fork of the Bitcoin Blockchain. Earlier this month, the creator of Bitcoin Platinum claimed that a group of miners, developers, investors and Bitcoin users will hard fork the Bitcoin protocol at block 498,577.However, the Twitter account has not provided the public with any information about supporters, developers, investors and/or miners. Even before this most recent incident that set off the South Korean Bitcoin community, investors remained highly skeptical of the project given its vague description and vision. Bitcoin Platinum claimed to achieve “Satoshi’s original vision of Bitcoin as decentralized electronic cash,” copying the vision of Bitcoin Cash.Adding to the skepticism, the Bitcoin Platinum account has not offered any additional information apart from PR gibberish. One statement from Bitcoin Platinum read:“Bitcoin Platinum brings true Blockchain ledger to the world. Merchants and users are empowered with low fees and reliable confirmations. The future shines brightly with unrestricted growth, global adoption, permissionless innovation and decentralized development.”Earlier today, on Dec. 10, after releasing all of the statements in English since the first week of November, the Bitcoin Platinum Twitter account holder wrote in Korean:The brief statements above, written with a highly informal tone, read:“[Bitcoin] shorting very good,” and “so who told you to buy Bitcoin, shorting [Bitcoin] is the best.”Based on the tweets released by Bitcoin Platinum, the motivation behind the Bitcoin Platinum project evidently was to try to decrease the price of Bitcoin by introducing a hard fork and profit off the short-term price trend of Bitcoin by shorting it.JoongAng and other South Korean mainstream media outlets revealed that the administrator of the Bitcoin Platinum Twitter account and the creator of the project, which is now suspected be a scam, is a South Korean teenager, who allegedly introduced the project to find an opportunity to short Bitcoin in the South Korean Bitcoin exchange market.The teenager then admitted on Twitter from the Bitcoin Platinum account that the project was created as a scam. The Bitcoin Platinum creator wrote:“Please forgive me. Bitcoin Platinum is a scam coin. I created the project to earn five mln Korean won ($4,590).”Last month, a $200 mln Ponzi scheme was unraveled, which targeted middle-aged investors. The operators of the Ponzi scheme established a Bitcoin consultancy firm in Seoul, lured in investors in the market, and offered unrealistic profit margins, claiming that their money would be invested in Bitcoin.Ultimately, the five individuals behind the Ponzi scheme were arrested, as investors requested a local police department to investigate into the scam many months after they did not receive any payouts from the operators.In the upcoming months, the South Korean government and its cryptocurrency task force formed by five ministries and commissions, including the ministry of strategy and finance, will create policies to regulate the South Korean cryptocurrency market. The upcoming regulation is an effort to crackdown on scams and fraudulent operations, such as the $200 mln Ponzi scheme mentioned above and, most recently, Bitcoin Platinum.",13

We are currently investigating the nature of the incident and, as a result, we are stopping all operations for the next 24 hours. Importantly, our payment system was compromised and the contents of the NiceHash Bitcoin wallet have been stolen. We are working to verify the precise number of BTC taken.“Clearly, this is a matter of deep concern and we are working hard to rectify the matter in the coming days. In addition to undertaking our own investigation, the incident has been reported to the relevant authorities and law enforcement and we are co-operating with them as a matter of urgency.”The company is apparently planning to resume operations, although it’s uncertain how they will retain their users following a hack of this magnitude. Nicehash wrote:“We are fully committed to restoring the NiceHash service with the highest security measures at the earliest opportunity…“While the full scope of what happened is not yet known, we recommend, as a precaution, that you change your online passwords. We are truly sorry for any inconvenience that this may have caused and are committing every resource towards solving this issue as soon as possible.”Nicehash isn’t a mining pool, per se. Rather, it’s a site that allows owners of mining equipment to rent out their hashpower to buyers. Sellers of hashpower find it convenient because they don’t have to spend as much time finding the most profitable coins to mine. Buyers are happy that they don’t have to buy expensive mining equipment for what may merely be a short but intense bout of mining.It’s unclear what, if any, effect this hack will have on other mining pools. The vast majority of cryptocurrency mining is done by users who “pool” their efforts together through a centralized service, called a mining pool. They trust the pool to pay them a percentage of every block the pool successfully mines, proportional to the amount of hashing they’ve done. Pools have been criticised in the past for creating centralization in what is intended to be a decentralized currency movement.A great many mining pools are located in China, including some of the largest, such as AntPool, F2Pool, BTCC, BW Pool and others. Private mining pools, such as BitFury, are also significant players in the industry.",7
Major Wallet Vulnerability Revealed As User Barely Reclaims 9 BTC,Joshua Althauser,2017-12-04 13:08:00,36735,167,"An anonymous Pastebin user claimed to have discovered evidence that some Bitcoin wallet software can generate private keys that can be easily identified and hacked.The reveal comes after another person has made a Reddit post describing how they lost nine BTC due to a transaction error on the Blockchain.info wallet service.The Pastebin user, however, didn't reveal the specific wallet software that can be possibly affected and whether the software vulnerability is intentional or just a simple coding error.According to the anonymous user, several users of Blockchain.info platform are already aware of the vulnerability and have ‘played’ with the chain by sending small amounts of Bitcoins to the addresses corresponding to the private keys generated by the malicious software.“If you peer into the Blockchain, you will find that people have ‘played’ with the chain by sending small amounts of Bitcoins to addresses corresponding to private keys generated using Sha256… It’s quite obvious these were _meant_ to be found. It turns out there are a lot of these addresses. (Keep looking and you will easily find some.)  This is nothing new and has been known to the Bitcoin community for a while.”According to the Pastebin user, he used several pieces of publicly available data on the Blockchain to determine if they could have been used to create wallets. He utilized block hashes for every block since the Genesis Block, Merkle roots from every block, common words and phrases that have been hashed a number of times, and eventually started testing all the Bitcoin addresses.He also downloaded a complete index of all Bitcoin addresses that were listed publicly on Blockchain and began to discover keys that could have a few bits associated with them. In his experiments, he discovered more than 40 Bitcoin addresses that were used at certain points over the past seven years as of November 2017 to send Bitcoin.The Pastebin user has also suspected that some third-party wallet custodial service like gambling site, mining pool or a straight-up web wallet could have malicious code in their backend that can generate private keys based on public addresses.As of press time, the Blockchain.info user has confirmed that the funds have been returned:“The nine BTC have been returned, the person found my Reddit post & reached out to me this morning. He wants to remain anonymous however he has found an issue with Blockchain.info and is currently working with them to resolve the issue.”",4
Kenyan Police Arrest Bitcoin Traders Due to Alleged Banking Fraud,Joshua Althauser,2017-12-04 09:11:00,22638,201,"The Kenyan police have arrested three peer-to-peer Bitcoin brokers Emma Kariuki, Stanley Mumo, and Timothy Gachehe for allegedly trading stolen money through the local trading platform LocalBitcoins. The funds were reportedly stolen by a person using the pseudonym “BADASS20” from the I&M Bank and a Safaricom Pay Bill account.According to a report by regional media Kenyan Wall Street, the anonymous thief has stolen KEH 10.2 mln (around $100,000) from the financial establishments and used the money to purchase Bitcoins via the exchange LocalBitcoins.The local police were able to trace the stolen money to various bank accounts, including those owned by the arrested Bitcoin traders.During the police investigation, the traders claimed that they were not aware that the money used by the anonymous thief to buy Bitcoin was stolen and they were just doing what they claimed as a “normal” trading activity. Based on their chat history on the trading platform, they seem to be telling the truth.In spite of their seemingly valid defense, the Kenyan Banking Fraud Investigation Unit (BFIU) still arrested the traders and froze their bank accounts. The brokers, however, were able to post bails and were eventually released. They are scheduled to attend a preliminary hearing in December 2017 in advance of a full hearing in January 2018.The digital currency peer-to-peer (P2P) market in Kenya is flourishing despite the warning issued by the country’s central bank in 2015, advising citizens to refrain from transacting Bitcoin and other virtual currencies.This latest case of banking fraud involving the cryptocurrencies is expected to have a chilling effect on the local virtual currency market. It remains to be seen, however, if this incident will compel the government to introduce drastic measures to regulate the market or the industry players will just consider it as an isolated case and ignore it.",3
Bitcoin Account Holder Loses $100K Over Public Wireless Network,Joshua Althauser,2017-11-24 10:46:00,49046,954,"An unidentified 36-year-old man who owns a Bitcoin account has lost more than 100,000 euros ($117,000) worth of Bitcoins while he was logged in on a public wireless network in a restaurant in Vienna, Austria.The Austrian police, however, claimed that they are still investigating whether the victim’s account was already hacked before he opened his account on the unsecured network, CBS reports.This latest case reflects the growing concern over the security of digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum amidst their growing popularity as a mode of payment.Perhaps the most infamous loss of Bitcoins due to security issues took place in 2014 when the Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox has collapsed following a breach on its platform and a significant amount of cryptocurrency was stolen. The exchange’s former CEO, Mark Karpelès, is currently being tried in Japan on charges of data manipulation and embezzlement.In mid-2017, the biggest Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange in South Korea, Bithumb, was also assaulted by hackers and stole cryptocurrencies worth an estimated 1.2 bln won or more than $1 mln. A man from Pennsylvania has also admitted that he stole $40 mln worth of Bitcoins just recently.Despite these incidents, the digital currencies continue to increase in popularity among investors. Because of this, Ethereum price, for example, has already surged by 2,600 percent in just a matter of months from just $8.17 in early 2017. The leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin, meanwhile, has increased to over $8,000 so far from $1,027 early in the year.During trading in New York on Nov. 21, 2017, Bitcoin price has reached a new record high of $8,339 despite earlier losses in the day due to the reported $31 mln theft of Tether.",32
"Confido ICO Raises $340K, Vanishes",Jon Buck,2017-11-22 11:55:00,35832,421,"In a move that’s sure to draw the ire of ICO naysayers, a recent ICO has completely vanished after raising $347,000. The ICO, called Confido, sold tokens called CFD and claimed to offer ‘safe and trustless cryptocurrency payments.’The site and the project’s subreddit have completely disappeared, leaving no trace of the funds or the founders. The alleged founder and president, Joost van Doorn, who was previously employed with eBay, posted a message to the company’s Reddit feed saying:“We are in a tight spot, as we are having legal trouble caused by a contract we signed. We signed the contract with assurance from our legal advisor that there was minimal risk and it would not be an issue. I can’t and won’t go into details, but he was wrong. It is a problem.”The full message is available here, as an archived Medium article.The company was hosted by TokenLot, who has no knowledge of the whereabouts of the coins. The ICO apparently was a scam, and while tokens were issued, no actual work ever took place on the platform. Rather, due to legal issues, the company simply disappeared and all trace of its founders has vanished.As a result of the disappearance, the price of the Confido token has lost over 90 percent of its value.ICOs are still widely considered a very risky business, as governments are seeking direction on regulation. This leaves the consumer at risk.",1
Breaking: Tether Allegedly Hacked For $30 Mln,Jon Buck,2017-11-21 09:00:00,27149,455,"According to a post on its website, Tether has experienced a substantial hacking event, with a loss of over $30 mln from the Tether Treasury account. The loss was discovered when the tokens were sent to an unauthorized Bitcoin address. According to the post, Tether is taking all possible action to prevent further disruption, saying:“Yesterday, we discovered that funds were improperly removed from the Tether treasury wallet through malicious action by an external attacker. Tether integrators must take immediate action, as discussed below, to prevent further ecosystem disruption.”The site also says that all Tether wallet services have been suspended pending a thorough investigation of the cause of the hack. Further, Tether is releasing a new version of Omni Core via hard fork in order to prevent the attacker from moving funds into any other wallet. Tether is encouraging all users to immediately upgrade their Omni Core to the new, protected version. Tether will continue pursuing ways to reclaim the coins stranded by the hack.The team of Tether has reached out to major exchanges to ask them to blacklist the addresses involved in the attack, as indicated by this comment issued by Konstantin Gladych, the CEO of Changelly:""Tether team has warned Changelly, so we’ve immediately halted all USDT deposits and withdrawals. Currently, we are working with the largest crypto exchanges for thorough investigation of the hack issues. We’ve blacklisted the wallet address of frauds and now are waiting for the official update of the OMNI/Tether client.""The company assured its users that Tether issuances have not been impacted by the hack and that all functionality and tokens are backed by assets as normal. According to the post:“…all Tether tokens remain fully backed by assets in the Tether reserve. The only tokens that will not be redeemed are the ones that were stolen from Tether treasury yesterday. Those tokens will be returned to treasury once the Omni Layer protocol enhancements are in place.”These events come at a difficult time for Tether, as it has recently been under fire by some community members for its transparency policies.  Twitter has already provided a series of analyses, many of which are not positive. For example: (thread) So tracing the #Tether hack:This was the Tether ""treasury"" *multi-sig* wallet that was hacked: https://t.co/MUm7QmKTwOYou can see the hacker stole not just the USDT but also ~5 BTC that was in the wallet for some reason: https://t.co/lqHK7kJFau ",1
Major Risk For Mobile Android Wallet Users,Jon Buck,2017-11-20 11:25:00,28730,650,"Mobile Android cryptocurrency wallet users are at risk for hacking because of a new vulnerability that allows the MediaProjection service to capture the user’s screen and audio content. More than three-quarters of all Android users are at risk, as the bug affects the Lollipop, Marshmallow and Nougat platforms.Google has accidentally created the risk, since the release of Lollipop 5.0. Prior to this release, the MediaProjection functionality was only available to system-level applications and through release keys. All new systems since have been vulnerable to this type of data attack.Apparently, when a hacker seeks to start recording screen information, a popup will appear, informing the user. However, hackers are able to cover that popup with a second popup in a process called ‘tapjacking.’ According to experts on the topic:""Furthermore, the SystemUI pop-up is the only access control mechanism available that prevents the abuse of the MediaProjection service. An attacker could trivially bypass this mechanism by using tapjacking this pop-up using publicly known methods to grant their applications the ability to capture the user’s screen.”Google has offered a patch in the Oreo (8.0) version, but all previous versions are at risk. Cryptocurrency users who access private wallets on mobile devices could very easily have their wallets hacked via this system and are encouraged to upgrade to the latest system for protection.",3
"JPMorgan Guilty of Money Laundering, Tried To Hide Swiss Regulator Judgement",William Suberg,2017-11-17 11:55:00,31087,1192,"JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon is facing irony this week after calling Bitcoin a fraud - as the bank’s Swiss arm is sanctioned for fraud.Reports from local media outlet Die Handelszeitung relate how the Swiss regulator Finma had ruled JPMorgan was guilty of money laundering in June.A legal battle then ensued, with Dimon’s giant attempting to prevent the publication of Finma’s judgment.This month, however, the law ruled against it, but details of the extent of the wrongdoing remain sketchy.The news is especially amusing to Bitcoin proponents, who watched as Dimon’s accusations that the virtual currency was a “fraud” sent it into temporary freefall in September.Commentators such as Andreas Antonopoulos were quick to jump on the gratifying reversal of fortune, the cryptocurrency expert telling the audience during a Q&A session this week that “Jamie doth protest too much methinks.”“It’s interesting how the head of the largest investment bank in the world finds time in his very busy day to speak about a ‘nothing;’ an irrelevant little technology that has no impact on the world,” he added. “It’s almost disconcerting that he would pay so much attention.”Dimon had followed his outburst against Bitcoin several weeks later with an announcement he would “no longer talk about it,” while other senior figures at the bank said it was “open-minded” in its treatment of the technology.",7
Buyer Beware: Cryptocurrency ‘Pump and Dump’ Schemes Coordinated In Telegram,Jon Buck,2017-11-15 12:40:00,43460,1113,"Telegram, an instant messaging service founded by Pavel Durov, is being used by cryptocurrency scammers to coordinate pump-and-dump schemes, as reported by Business Insider. These scammers create exclusive groups, in which they share information and organize attacks to make a profit off the losses suffered by unaware traders.The phenomenon of pump-and-dump is not uncommon in other trading venues either, particularly stocks and equities markets. However, the strict regulations imposed on those markets make this sort of price manipulation illegal, as opposed to the unregulated crypto world. In fact, the recent pump and dump plans in the crypto sphere may be being coordinated by outside forces.The Russian app, Telegram, appears to be the main venue where the pump and dump schemes are being perpetrated. According to Business Insider, a number of channels within Telegram are designed specifically for just this sort of market manipulation. With names like PumpKing Community, Crypto4Pumps and We Pump, these communities provide a venue for scammers to attract participants who then help the price move.These channels offer information on specific coin pumps to those who subscribe and then encourage subscribers to buy in quickly. After the glut of buying and the resultant price increase, members reach out in other social media, encouraging further buying from unsuspecting victims. As the price continues to rise, the pumpers begin to sell, causing panic selling, and collapsing the price - the ‘dump.’- A message distributed in Telegram to advertise one of the pump and dump groupsThe victims are left holding the bag, and the coin value often ends lower than it did before the scam. The entire process is a scam from start to finish. With the SEC and other international regulating bodies coming on board, this phenomenon may be curtailed. However, for now, buyers should avoid such jumps unless underlying fundamentals provide reasons for the change.",7
North Korean Hackers Attack Cryptocurrency Users And Service Providers,Joshua Althauser,2017-11-15 08:40:00,13387,320,"The Korea Internet & Security Agency (KISA) has claimed that cybercriminals based in North Korea have intensified their malware attacks against digital currency users and service providers in South Korea. The agency further said that the hackers have also targeted digital currency companies in the country.Based on its latest report as of mid-November 2017, KISA has monitored a 370 percent increase in malware attacks in 2017 as compared from the figures in 2016. These attacks show that the hackers have been consistent in their efforts to disrupt the day-to-day operations of companies, steal money and further taint the image of digital currencies.Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have been claimed as the perfect tool for cybercrimes in the past.Based on the KISA report, 5,366 ransomware attacks were recorded in South Korea from January to September 2017. The ongoing tussle between North and South Korea is considered as one of the main reasons behind the intensifying malware attacks on South Korean establishments.This is particularly true in the months of July and August, in which malicious software was uncovered in multiple in-house desktop systems of many South Korean Bitcoin exchanges.According to the agency, it expects that the attacks on Bitcoin service providers and other online services in South Korea will continue to intensify in the near future unless a strategic action is launched to thwart the attacks moving forward. This view by the agency is predicated on the reputation of North Korean hackers, who have launched vicious attacks against South Korean infrastructure in the past few years.The continuous presence of state-sponsored hacker groups in North Korea is also expected to worsen the situation. Because of these developments, South Korean citizens and companies should take this threat more seriously and collaborate with the government in preventing it.",1
Pirate Mining Moving onto Android Phones?,Darryn Pollock,2017-11-13 16:50:00,13393,253,"Depending on how one looks at it, the scourge of malware pirate mining, or the ingenious alternative to advertising retail, has taken off in recent times. Sites like The Pirate Bay and Showtime have been found out for using Javascript to mine cryptocurrencies with users’ processing power.However, the market for this manner of making cryptocurrency has started to spread as now a Russian app developer has tried to embed a puzzle game with a pirate crypto miner to utilize potentially millions of Android devices to mine cryptocurrencies.Russian developer Alexey Khripkov has described his creation as a legal Botnet, indicating his distribution of a crypto mining laced game onto the Google Play store.A Botnet is a horde of hacked computers that are controlled to perform a single task, utilizing the power of the mass. It is often used in DDoS attacks on websites.Khripkov has through a wildly popular game on the Play Store received access to potentially millions of Android devices which he can utilize for cryptocurrency mining as a plan to monetize the efforts.However, the plans and the implementation of this pirate mining device have been slightly scuppered for Khripkov. Anti-virus companies started blocking Puzzle, deciding the mining was malicious, as noted by cybersecurity researchers at Ixia, which published a blog on the developer's work. This has forced the developer to change tact as he continues to remain legal and not underhanded.Khripkov says he has removed the feature altogether and on top of that he has rather put out another app, Reward Digger, that would give them in-game bonuses for helping him mine coins.Opinions are divided on this form of mining. Some believe that it is malware and should not be allowed, while others believe it is a healthy alternative to advertising as a form of revenue.There are even some who are more inclined to utilize the pirate mining javascript maliciously and secretly, while on the other hand, one of the biggest names in the game, Coinhive, calls for transparency.Yuchen Zhou said at security company Palo Alto:""The use of Coinhive or similar mining services is itself not a malicious activity. It is how they are used that makes the sites malicious.""Khripkov explained his position:""I do not do any evil things like illegal botnets... In my app you can control mining, you enable if it’s acceptable for you or disable if you do not want it. It is not hidden for users, so it is fully legal.”""How my miner works in my app: users choose in settings the intensity of mining, then put the phone on charge. Now the app will wait until the phone is fully charged and start mining altcoins... If the phone [runs out of battery] or overheats, the mining stops.”",[]
Phone Data of ‘Almost Every Malaysian’ Goes On Sale For 1 Bitcoin,William Suberg,2017-11-03 15:50:00,43256,523,"A fresh major security hack has seen the phone records of “almost every Malaysian” go on sale for just one Bitcoin.In what Reuters describes as “one of the largest data breaches in Asia,” hackers gained access to 46 mln customer identity details. These include “lists of mobile phone numbers, identification card numbers, home addresses and SIM card data.”“This stolen data may ultimately impact almost every Malaysian,” chief technology officer for Asia Pacific at cybersecurity firm FireEye told the publication.The news comes in the wake of mass breaches at both Equifax and Deloitte, the former gaining particular notoriety due to the lax security setup researchers discovered as part of subsequent investigations.Having been known about since last month, Malaysia’s government is now in the process of identifying several likely sources as part of a full inquiry.“We have identified several potential sources of the leak and we should be able to complete the probe soon,” the country’s Communications and Multimedia Minister Salleh Said Keruak said.Reactions from security experts meanwhile said that the personal details of Malaysian mobile customers could now feature in fraudulent identity generation.The trove of data was on sale for a comparatively small sum - just one BTC, around $7,200 as of press time Friday.",1

"Fake ICOs, Common Crypto Scams and How to Avoid Them",Darryn Pollock,2017-11-03 12:05:00,25891,636,"The cryptocurrency world is full of stories of people who are either getting hacked for their precious digital currencies, or they are falling into scams and traps.Because of the decentralized and open nature of the cryptocurrency world, protection is not freely offered. Users are rather expected to be savvy enough to not fall for scams and traps, but that takes some work.Below are a number of notable types of scams and some tips on how to avoid them.The ICO market and its related frenzy have been unprecedented in recent times. As a crowdfunding exercise, companies have seen millions of dollars roll in in a matter of minutes as people look to invest in the latest startup or digital currency.However, scammers have also taken advantage of this frenzy by putting up fake ICOs.Fake ICOs are not that easy to spot, as some believe themselves that they are legitimate. What you should be looking for is proof of endorsements and involvement from reputable figures, as well as a legitimate team.The Whitepaper is also your go-to to determine if the company has a clear plan and idea, or if they are simply waffling on about nothing particular.Of course, some ICOs are not scams and are legitimate, but many still be a trap and something to avoid.Because the majority of cryptocurrency users use online wallets, they are also easy options for scammers to try and utilize in order to attack people’s cryptocurrency stashes.There are thousands of online wallet choices out there, but it is vital that you chose one that is reputable or that you have researched well and vetted. An added bonus, which is not always the case, is to go with one that does not store your private key.Because emails are so easily dished out, they are ideal tools for scammers to use to try and pry digital currencies off people in scams.Recently, a number of Blockchain enthusiasts have received emails from an address claiming to be MyEtherWallet. They were prompted to log into a fake version of the site to prevent losing their funds.Email scammers often pose as wallet providers and are often searching for people who are easily swayed to give out their private key. As a rule, you should never have to hand over your private key, especially not over email.While there are thousands of wallet providers, many of them scams and unreportable, the same applies for exchanges. It is again important to be savvy and smart when deciding on an exchange to use.A general rule is that although smaller exchanges may be fine, it is always best to go with big and popular ones. This can also help with avoiding odd pricing and fluctuations.Generally, it is quite easy to spot a fake exchange if you have been in the cryptocurrency world for a while; however, for an absolute newbie, it is best to go with the popular and well know ones.",5

In the case filed on Oct. 30, 2017, the accused has unlawfully taken over more than 100 brokerage accounts and used the victim's’ funds to artificially increase stock prices then trade against them to gain high profits.In its press release, the SEC claimed that Willner has utilized the services of an unnamed Bitcoin exchange to convert the funds from US dollars to Bitcoin to hide his profits. The proceeds of the exchange were transferred to another individual, who was not included in the case.Part of the release reads:""To mask his payments to the other individual as part of a profit-sharing arrangement, Willner allegedly transferred proceeds of profitable trades to a digital currency company that converts US dollars to Bitcoin and then transmitted the bitcoins as payment.""Based on the SEC lawsuit, Willner and his cohort have amassed at least $700,000 in profits from their alleged account take-over scam. In the investigation conducted by the SEC’s Cyber Unit, the account take-over scheme poses an increasingly major threat to retail investors.According to the SEC’s Division of Enforcement Co-Director Stephanie Avakian, the crime is a major threat to retail investors, so the newly-formed Cyber Unit is focusing on it.""Account takeovers are an increasingly significant threat to retail investors, and it is exactly the type of fraud our new Cyber Unit is focusing on.”The SEC’s Cyber Unit was introduced in September 2017 to focus on crimes involving digital currencies, as well as initial coin offerings (ICO) and distributed ledger technology, among others.",[]
New York Government Arrests Businessman Due to Alleged ICO Fraud,Lisa Froelings,2017-11-02 15:25:00,12815,242,"The US Attorney’s Office Eastern District of New York has announced that New York-based businessman Maksim Zaslavskiy was arrested on Nov. 1, 2017, due to securities fraud conspiracy in connection with two initial coin offerings (ICO).Zaslavskiy was recently accused by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of defrauding investors in the two ICOs.According to acting US Attorney Bridget Rohde, Zaslavskiy and his cohorts were able to attract investors by pledging returns from the novel ICOs even though they knew that no real estate or diamonds were actually supporting the investments.""As alleged, Zaslavskiy and his associates enticed investors by promising returns using novel ICOs even though Zaslavskiy knew that no real estate or diamonds were actually backing the investments.”Based on the charge, one ICO was marketed as being supported by real estate assets, while the other ICO was claimed to be backed by diamonds.In late September 2017, the SEC has filed charges against Zaslavskiy and two related firms, alleging that the businessman has misrepresented the amount he generated from the two ICOs. At the time, the SEC was also successful in securing a court order to freeze the assets of Zaslavskiy and the two companies.The prosecutors in the case have further claimed that the purported assets that support the token sale did not actually exist. The two companies involved in the case are the Diamond Reserve Club (DRC) World and the REcoin Group Foundation.The case is being handled by the Office’s Business and Securities Fraud Section, with Assistant US Attorney Julia Nestor appointed in charge of the prosecution.

Arkansas Police Generates Its Own Cryptocurrency to Track Child Porn,Lisa Froelings,2017-10-31 11:05:00,10979,238,"The Cyber Crimes Division of the Benton County Sheriff’s Office in Arkansas has launched a pilot program involving the mining of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to monitor the activities of criminals online. The division has generated its own digital currency to track such crimes as the proliferation of child pornography.Based on data from the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), there has been an increase in the number of individuals who use Bitcoin and secret web browsers to trade or distribute child pornography, to illegally purchase drugs, as well as to engage in prostitution or human trafficking and other unlawful activities.In an interview with television news station KHBS in early October 2017, Benton County detective David Undiano claimed that the program aims to help their investigators to tackle crimes that they might have previously been unequipped to process.""People are selling child pornography on the dark web and on the Internet. They are accepting Bitcoins, not payments. We can't use the sheriff's office credit card, and we can’t exchange child pornography. We need some type currency to get this and then identify who we are getting it from. That way, we can go arrest that person.""However, despite the potential effectiveness of the campaign, some individuals seem not to be very supportive of it.In his interview with the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, potential sheriff candidate Glenn Latham voiced his opposition to the policy, claiming that it would eventually result in very high expenses that will be shouldered by local taxpayers.""These machines that they have to use draw a huge amount of power and cooling costs will go up.

Bitcoin Gold Off to Rocky Start After DDoS Attack,Darryn Pollock,2017-10-27 15:55:00,21842,685,"Recently, Bitcoin Gold became the latest “fork” of the original Bitcoin digital currency, joining Bitcoin Cash which was the first major hard fork back in August. However, Bitcoin Gold’s emergence has been far less controversial or even influential, but it has been rocky.The aim of Bitcoin Gold is to be a currency that hands power back to the ordinary miner and enable anyone with a graphics processing unit to mine the new cryptocurrency that has roots in the original Bitcoin.However, Bitcoin Gold has essentially zero chance of replacing Bitcoin in the marketplace as a ‘fork,’ it’s more of an air-drop than a chain split. And, as such, its entrance onto the stage, has been less than impressive.As Bitcoin Gold split, a tweet was sent out that alerted the community that a massive DDoS attack had hid the site.""Massive DDoS attack on our cloud site,"" stated a tweet from the Bitcoin Gold account. ""10M requests per minute. We are working with the providers to ban all the IPs. We will be up soon!""Massive DDoS attack on our cloud site. 10M requests per minute. We are working with the providers to ban all the IPs. We will be up soon!This means what probably happened was a network of hijacked devices were accessing the Bitcoin Gold site 10 mln times a minute in order to block out legitimate traffic.At 10 mln attacks a minute, it was a rather large hijacking, but still not the biggest.

At this time people will also receive a mirror balance of their Bitcoin in Bitcoin Gold.There have been warnings and non-support from many exchanges about Bitcoin Gold; however, there is still interest about for the chance of being additionally credited the equivalent amount of Bitcoin Gold.Bitcoin Gold futures were trading at $117.50 per coin on Bitfinex the day after the split.",3
UK Auditors Blast NHS ‘Basic’ Security Failures Over WannaCry Cyberattack,William Suberg,2017-10-27 12:50:00,20080,174,"The UK’s National Audit Office (NAO) has said the country’s health service failed to “follow best practices” to prevent the WannaCry cyberattack.The National Health Service (NHS) was one of the first major victims of May’s international Bitcoin ransomware, which demanded users pay $300 in order to regain access to infected computers.Despite being a “relatively unsophisticated attack,” the NAO said in a new report, the NHS was easy prey. WannaCry “could have been prevented by the NHS following basic IT security best practice.”“There are more sophisticated cyber-threats out there than WannaCry, so the Department (of Health) and the NHS need to get their act together to ensure the NHS is better protected against future attacks,” it advised.The report comes as a new variety of ransomware known as Bad Rabbit makes its way across the world, infecting public computer systems in Russia, Ukraine, elsewhere in Europe and even Japan.WannaCry was the most prolific attack of its kind, spreading easily due to a conspicuous lack of security guarding the IT systems of its victims.“The NHS could have fended off this attack if it had taken simple steps to protect its computers and medical equipment,” Meg Hillier, chair of the UK government’s public accounts committee reiterated.“...The NHS and the department need to get serious about cybersecurity or the next incident could be far worse.”Though the discovery of an antidote, WannaCry’s effect was limited after a certain point, and the attack was notable for the correspondingly meager amounts collected by hackers. This led Russia’s Internet advisor Herman Klimenko even to suggest the perpetrators were children.",[]
Bitcoin in Center of Dark Web Drug Dealing Case in Holland,Darryn Pollock,2017-10-26 16:20:00,19418,211,"Accused of laundering hundreds of thousands of euros through the digital currency Bitcoin, six men are facing charges in a Dutch court for apparently selling Bitcoin paid for by illegal drug sales.The men face potential sentences ranging from six to 36 months for crimes relating both to drug possession, as well as money laundering.There has been a crackdown on Bitcoin-related crimes as criminals continue to try and use it as a means to enact illegal and anonymous payments.The suspects allegedly met with Bitcoin traders in places with public access to wifi, swapping their ill-gotten online currency acquired on the Darknet for hard cash.The Bitcoin traders ""as opposed to normal currency exchange shops, did not ask for identification papers nor about the origin of the Bitcoins,"" prosecutors said in a statement.All six of the men, while appearing in front of the court, one by one denied the charges insisting they had acquired their Bitcoin haul legally.“My client is accused of having sold more than 460,000 euros in Bitcoin which he supposedly earned through drug trafficking,"" one lawyer Marielle van Essen told judges.""We complete refute it,"" she said.""I had a job, a good salary and no rent to pay. I acquired Bitcoins in a completely legal way,"" said her client, identified only as Mr. Bischop.The issue and attraction of Bitcoin is that it does not leave much of a paper trail and helps people remain anonymous in their transactions.Prosecutors, however, said the defense ""was unable to explain the origins of the astronomical sum of money"" earned by the accused, stressing that money-laundering posed ""a serious threat to our society.""",1
Bad Rabbit Bitcoin Ransomware Misery Continues As Hackers Demand $300 in BTC,William Suberg,2017-10-26 12:25:00,21210,330,"Over 200 victims in Europe and beyond continue to suffer from a brand new ransomware attack demanding Bitcoin to release encrypted files.Known as Bad Rabbit, the ransomware of unknown origin demands 0.05 BTC ($290) to unlock infected computers.Its progress focuses on Russia and Ukraine, with outbreaks also reported in Turkey and Germany, according to cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab.“While the target is visiting a legitimate website, a malware dropper is being downloaded from the threat actor’s infrastructure,” a report on the ransomware released Tuesday explains.“No exploits were used, so the victim would have to manually execute the malware dropper, which pretends to be an Adobe Flash installer. We’ve detected a number of compromised websites, all of which were news or media websites.”As of Thursday, it has become apparent those targets fall outside the news and media sphere, with Odessa Airport and the Kiev Metro’s payment system also seeing breakdowns.Bad Rabbit is just the latest cyberattack to hit the Russian and Ukrainian zone, with WannaCry and NotPetya all having left their mark over the past six months.The ransom demands from Bad Rabbit’s hackers are similar to those of WannaCry at around $300 per machine.Unlike NotPetya, however, there appears to be no attempt to wipe data from victims, whether or not they send the requisite Bitcoins.Unlike #ExPetr, #BadRabbit is not a wiper. pic.twitter.com/JeBnD8q9DVKaspersky adds it is not yet known whether or not paying the ransomware amount results in full control being returned.",2
Crypto Crime Keeping Pace with Crypto Rise,Darryn Pollock,2017-10-25 09:50:00,11406,240,"The rising value of cryptocurrencies is likely to push up corporate ransom and extortion demands, a UK cyber security company warns. With Bitcoin reaching over $6,000 this week and other more anonymous coins also jumping in value, it is becoming more lucrative for criminals.There have been highly publicized cases where cybercriminals and hackers have taken corporations hostage with their ransom demanded in cryptocurrencies. Now, there is an even bigger incentive to make high demands as the payoffs are much larger.Demands for at least $25 mln are likely to increase because technological changes in virtual currencies are making it easier for criminals to move sums anonymously, says MWR InfoSecurity.MRW, which tests cyber defenses for banks and governments, has made the risks known to several large city institutions in a report that focuses on the effects of the growing interest in trading cryptocurrencies.It is not only the high price of these digital currencies that are making it attractive to criminals; it is because the surge in demand is slowly building the depth and liquidity of the market.The growing liquidity makes it easier for buyers and sellers of assets to conduct transactions without dramatically moving the asset’s price and rising prices enable larger sums to change hands more easily.“A single transaction that consumes much of the liquidity of a market is very likely to be noticed, whilst a proportionally smaller transaction on a larger marketplace will generate less attention. As such, increasing liquidity of cryptocurrencies will mean criminals can extract greater values,” the report said.In July, it emerged that British companies were stockpiling cryptocurrency in case of ransomware attacks. They were prepared to pay on average £136,000 to regain access to critical data and intellectual property.However, since there has been an increase in value, as well as the Blockchain infrastructure with the implementation of SegWit, things have become smoother for everyone including criminals.Collecting real-world cash that could be spent anonymously presented problems for criminals until earlier this year, the report added, in part because the Blockchain, the infrastructure underpinning Bitcoin, sometimes took minutes or hours to finalize payments. Until then, ransomware demands were limited to about $40,000, the report argued.But in late July Bitcoin split into two currencies and transaction payment times have been speeded up.",3
Japanese Ripple Crypto Exchange Takes Hit as Founder Arrested for Scam,Darryn Pollock,2017-10-19 15:25:00,23377,231,"Ripple cryptocurrency exchange in Hamamatsu, Shizuoka Prefecture, was raided by police as they closed in on the manager of the exchange who was looking to make off with ¥1.4 mln ($12,470) of one of their customer’s money.Yuki Takenaka, the 31-year-old founder and head of a company operating the Ripple exchange, collected his stolen funds even though his firm was in a state of collapse and unable to make refunds at that time.It is the first arrest in Japan made in connection with a bourse of the Ripple virtual currency, as Takenaka has admitted to most of the charges, according to the police.Having set up the exchange in May 2014, Takenaka quickly fell out of favour as users were unable to withdraw cash or contact him.In a strange business model, his company collected money from its users in exchange for IOUs, or written acknowledgements of debt, needed for Ripple online transactions. Users could exchange the notes with Ripple or convert them into cash.But it has also emerged that Takenaka allegedly swindled more than ¥10 mln out of a dozen users by false advertising that his company charges no commission.Additionally, there are investigations into the supposed issuing of fictitious IOUs which amount to approximately ¥120 mln.Ripple, as a cryptocurrency, is slightly different to others, as they are looking to become a legitimate digital currency for use within the banking sector; and they pride themselves on being centralised.The Ripple currency is usually used for international payments and cannot be used for merchandise purchases.Ripple is looking to break into the banking market with its tough regulations, and while this incident has nothing to do with Ripple as a currency, it shows yet again that the crypto market is still a wild west for many and there is very little protection for individuals.",2
500 Million Users Affected Every Month By Pirates to Mine Cryptocurrency,Darryn Pollock,2017-10-17 12:10:00,18807,321,"Experts at AdGuard have suggested that the new phenomenon that has seen a couple of sites caught using website visitor’s CPU power to mine cryptocurrency, may in fact be a bigger issue than first believed.First there was illegal torrent site, The Pirate Bay, that was shown to be secretly mining Monero through Javascript; a way for them to increase their revenue separate from advertising. Then it was online streaming site, ShowTime, that also exhibited the same Javascript.However, the pirate mining pandemic seems to be much larger as AdGuard have suggested that over 220 sites are actively, and mostly secretly, doing it, affecting over half-a-billion users a month.Many of these sites, especially the ones that have come forward and admitted that they are using users’ CPU power to mine cryptocurrency, are using things like CoinHive and JSEcoin.These scripts work in their browsers to verify blockchain transactions, which tend to require significant computational resources. In the last three weeks, AdGuard estimated that the people behind these schemes have made approximately $43,000.The likes of CoinHive have expressed their dissatisfaction with the secretive nature that many sites have gone about things when it has come to using their script. In fact, many responded to The Pirate Bay, after they came clean, saying they don’t mind, as long as they can give consent.Coinhive publicly asked those using its script to adopt a permission-based model, but it may be impossible to make such requests compulsory. Although this mining is not as malicious as infecting users with Malware, it still puts additional strain and wear-and-tear on people's’ CPUs.Because cryptocurrencies are such a hot commodity, the rush to get hands on them has seen many different and diverse methods crop up.In fact, the purposeful implementation of scripts is not even the only way that Pirate miners are profiting.PolitiFact, a fact-checking website, was running a script to mine cryptocurrency but has since removed it. The site is now conducting an investigation into the script’s origins.",7
Hackers’ Delight?

My husband bought two for 1000 rubles, came home and they turned out to be fake and it's not possible to sell them.""Since 1000 rubles equates to about $17, that deal would seem too good to be true.Indeed, the Gypsies persuaded the man that the price of Bitcoin was on the rise and not showing signs of slowing - no lies there. He was told that there were several more thousand rubles to be made off his own 1000 ruble investment.The coins bear the recognisable Bitcoin logo, pressed upon a circuit board-looking background. But, of course, being physical, they are worth very little other than their novelty value.One person on the message board offered some helpful advice for the hapless couple, saying that they may be able to sell them for that novelty value at an online trading site - probably for about 300 rubles.",5
Why Are Cryptocurrencies Increasingly Becoming a Favorite Among Criminals?,Joshua Althauser,2017-10-05 17:20:00,12898,186,"Global investment management firm BlackRock Inc. chief executive Larry Fink claimed in early October 2017 that the significant increase in the popularity of Bitcoin and other digital currencies such as Zcash, Monero, among others, reflects the extent of money laundering activities occurring around the world. It is believed that digital assets like Bitcoin are being used for tax evasion, money laundering, and online gambling.In a Bloomberg interview at the BlackRock Fixed Income ETF conference held in New York, Fink claimed that he believes in the potential of Bitcoin and other virtual currencies, despite the current speculative atmosphere regarding their use.“I am a big believer in the potential in what cryptocurrencies can do.”Meanwhile, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon has called Bitcoin a “fraud”, and said it’s worse than the seventeenth century asset bubble involving tulip bulbs, further adding that the leading cryptocurrency will “eventually blow up.”“It’s worse than tulip bulbs and won’t end well.”Bitcoin and the other virtual currencies currently have a combined market value of around $144 bln based on data from Coinmarketcap.com. Bitcoin accounts for about 50 percent of the total value.Fink expressed his optimistic view on the open-source, distributed ledger called Blockchain, which is the driver behind the digital currencies. He claimed that the Blockchain technology has the capability to expedite the “more flow-through of information.”Meanwhile, the leading virtual cryptocurrency Bitcoin posted a 2.6 percent decline to $4,288 in the latest trading.Bitcoin, however, already increased by around 350 percent in 2017. In comparison, the S&P 500 index (SPX) has risen by 13 percent during the year, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) has surged by 14.5 percent.Image: Science MagWhile Bitcoin transactions are not entirely anonymous - one’s cookies gathered through various web activities may still be tracked - cryptocurrencies allow for faster and global transactions, which is probably far more important for those who choose to conduct transactions over the dark web. The European Union, however, considers such move to be stupid, since tracking activities is not entirely impossible once the authorities are involved.",5

Feds Claim Proceeds from Seized Silk Road Fortune at Only $334 per Bitcoin,Darryn Pollock,2017-10-03 14:20:00,11599,224,"The US Justice Department was finally able to claim the proceeds from the sale of 144,336 Bitcoins sized when they shut down illicit online market, the Silk Road, in 2013.Ross Ulbricht, also known as the Dread Pirate Roberts, and the man behind the Silk Road, recently gave up his claim to these seized coins as he remains behind bars.The amount collected by the Feds was around $48 mln for the 144,336 coins, far below their worth at today’s prices as it seems even the Justice Department fell folly to the old adage of selling low.The seized Bitcoins were sold off in a series of auctions back in 2014 and 2015, and the accumulation of $48 mln indicates that they averaged to price of the coins at $334.In retrospect, the sale appears to be a matter of bad timing for the government: the price of a Bitcoin was as high as $1,000 at the end of 2013 before the digital currency went into a prolonged slump until mid-2016 when it began to soar.The current price is around $4,400 - meaning the Justice Department would have made around $630 mln had the sale taken place today.It was only last week that Ulbricht decided to formally drop the claims he had to the Bitcoin that was sized. According to the office of Joon H. Kim, the Acting US Attorney for Manhattan, it means the government now has rights to the proceeds.The reason for Ulbricht challenging the seizure came in part because of the corrupt secret service agents that were exposed in the investigation.Two agents were implicated in corruption, one from the Drug Enforcement Agency and the other from the Secret Service, who posed as criminals in order to steal Bitcoins.Despite the actions of the corrupt officials, there was still more than enough evidence to sink Ulbricht including detailed server and chat records that identified him as the ""Dread Pirate Roberts"" who built and controlled Silk Road.",1

SEC Files Charges Against Startups Due to Alleged ICO Scam,Joshua Althauser,2017-10-01 13:50:00,14645,243,"US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has announced in a press release in late September 2017 that it filed charges against two startup firms and their founder, businessman Maksim Zaslavskiy, due to the alleged violation of the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws.The startups are Diamond Reserve Club World (DRC World) and REcoin Group Foundation. The SEC claimed that Zaslavskiy utilized the initial coin offering (ICO) fundraising model to advance his illegal activities.According to the US securities regulator, Zaslavskiy sold digital currencies by offering non-existing assets in two ICO sales. REcoin’s ICO was reportedly aimed at raising funds for real estate investment, while DRC World's token sale was intended for investments in diamonds.The SEC claimed that Zaslavskiy launched REcoin as “the first ever cryptocurrency backed by real estate.”He also allegedly touted that the startup had a team of lawyers, brokers, professionals and accountants who will invest the money raised by REcoin from its ICO into real estate.Zaslavskiy, however, allegedly misrepresented the money raised from the ICO, claiming it to be between $2-4 mln when the actual proceed is around $300,000.Likewise, the SEC said that Zaslavskiy has established DRC World when the agency ‘interfered’ with REcoin’s activities.Based on Zaslavskiy’s announcement on a Bitcoin forum on Sep. 11, 2017, members of DRC World can easily exchange their tokens for physical diamonds on the startup’s platform in real time basis.SEC, however, claimed that DRC World had neither diamond investments nor business operations.The SEC has frozen the assets of both companies and Zaslavskiy via an emergency court order from a federal district court in Brooklyn, New York.The agency is also planning to impose fines on the companies and order them to return all funds raised to investors. It also plans to prohibit Zaslavskiy from taking part in any digital securities offerings in the future.",5
"Robbers Pose as Bitcoin Traders in India, Arrested",Jacob J,2017-10-01 12:30:00,42043,295,"A gang of youngsters, who thought they could make a quick buck by posing as Bitcoin traders and robbing businessmen, have been arrested by the Delhi police.A group of six people who posed as Bitcoin traders and robbed a businessman of INR 3.6 mln ($55,000) have been arrested by the police in Delhi, the capital of India. The businessman had earlier registered his personal details on LocalBitcoins.com. He received a call from a woman, who introduced herself as Karishma Rajput and offered to sell him Bitcoins at a very good price. When the businessman met her with cash at a mall to complete the transaction, he was led to an apartment in the nearby town of Ghaziabad, where he was robbed. He was then thrashed and let off with a warning not to approach the police.This particular gang had robbed two other persons before running out of luck. Often, the victims who are robbed hesitate to approach the police if the money which has been robbed is unaccounted for. They are then wary about disclosing the source of the money robbed to the police, which might result in the police taking action against them. These criminals were banking on the victims not approaching the police but were unlucky the third time. The police arrested six gang members, which included a bankrupt property salesman, a law college graduate and his girlfriend.The gang of robbers offered to sell the businessman Bitcoins at Rs 72,000 ($1,100), which is a whopping 70 percent discount to the current market price of Bitcoin. This should set alarm bells ringing in any rational person's mind. They offered further discounts if the businessman paid in cash, instead of bank transfer. Unfortunately, this businessman took the bait and agreed to buy the Bitcoins. When something looks too good to be true, it definitely isn't in the crypto world.",[]
SEC Files Charges Against Two ICOs,Jon Buck,2017-09-30 09:40:00,16768,287,"The SEC has made good on its warning to ICOs regarding tokenization schemes as unregistered securities. The charges were leveled at REcoin and DRC (Diamond Reserve Club), both ICOs founded by Maksim Zaslavskiy.REcoin was initially touted as a coin offered with backing in real estate assets purchased with proceeds from the ICO. Zaslavskiy told investors that the company had a ‘team of lawyers, professionals, brokers and accountants’ that would complete the purchases, when in fact, no one had been hired.He also indicated to investors that he had raised between $2 and $4 mln, when the actual figure was closer to $300,000.Zaslavskiy also sold coins within the DRC ICO scheme, telling investors that the company had relationships with diamond wholesalers who would sell to him at a discount. Investors were promised sizable gains from the diamond arbitrage process.However, as with REcoin, the DRC scheme was simply a shell for taking funds from unsuspecting investors. Zaslavskiy had actually never done any business dealings with diamond sellers, nor was there any company business being transacted.The SEC reiterated their warnings, both to investors and potential ICOs. To the public, the Commission made it clear that investors should beware, saying:""Investors should be wary of companies touting ICOs as a way to generate outsized returns. As alleged in our complaint, Zaslavskiy lured investors with false promises of sizeable returns from novel technology.""At the same time, the charges serve as a warning to other ICOs who seek to lure in investors with promises of returns. The SEC’s recent actions should serve as a strong warning that ICOs will be researched and targeted for prosecution unless they are careful about regulatory honesty.The SEC has obtained a court order to freeze Zaslavskiy’s assets and is seeking repayment to investors as well as penalties, interest, and an order barring him from an officer or director position in the future.",3
Wolf of Wall Street Calls Bitcoin a “Fraud”,Chrisjan Pauw,2017-09-27 17:10:00,29218,795,"Yet another high-profile criticism came against Bitcoin, this time from the “Wolf of Wall Street” himself, Jordan Belfort.Belfort called Bitcoin a fraud and said that “the biggest problem I see from Bitcoin, and why I would never buy it, is because they can easily steal it from you through hacking. I know people who lost all their money like that.”It came only weeks after Chase Bank CEO Jamie Dimon called Bitcoin a fraud, and made his distaste for Bitcoin crystal clear when he suggested he would fire any employee trading Bitcoin on the company’s accounts. However, JP Morgan bought a large block of Bitcoins days after the CEO statement.But Jamie Dimon is not the only one with this view on Bitcoin. Ray Dalio, the founder and head of the world’s largest hedge fund Bridgewater, recently stated that Bitcoin is “a highly speculative market”, and in fact is a “bubble”.Belfort also finds it “bizarre” that Bitcoin is only backed by a program that creates artificial scarcity and said that because of this, the digital currency is not sustainable.Although Belfort believes in the concept of cryptocurrencies, he stated the current model holds too many problems. According to him, there is a future for digital currencies, but he thinks it’s essential for digital coins to get “some sort of backing” by central governments.In his opinion, a central bank will sooner or later introduce their own cryptocurrency, which will be more sustainable.“There will be a time when everybody is freaking out about Bitcoin and dumps it and who knows what’s going to happen?”In a situation like that there’s no buffer, for example the Federal Reserve, to cushion the blow.He issued a final warning to investors and said, “Be very careful not to invest a lot of money into something that could vanish very quickly.”",30

However, the investor, who took a self imposed exile from Wall Street, takes an interesting view of digital currencies.“This is going to be the largest bubble of our lifetimes,” Novogratz said.“Prices are going to get way ahead of where they should be. You can make a whole lot of money on the way up, and we plan on it.”Novogratz is renowned for being bold and brash, and it seems that the big swing and volatile digital currency space are exactly the kind of market he would thrive in.“I sold at $5,000 or $4,980,” he said. “Then three weeks later I’m trying to buy it in the low $3,000s. If you’re good at that and you’re a trading junkie, it’s a lot of fun.”There have been polar opposite views on Bitcoin and digital currencies recently, from those who are in the know when it comes to investing.People like Jamie Dimon of JP Morgan came out and slammed Bitcoin as a fraud, however, they were also seen to be looking in and exploring digital currencies and Blockchain technology.These non-believers have recently seen their arguments backed up as governments and other regulatory bodies have cracked down in some areas of the world, namely China.However, just like there are two sides to the Dimon coin, some even see the Bitcoin ban in China as an opportunity, and that is the way Novogratz is operating, despite calling it a massive bubble.“In a lot of ways, this is a market like any other market,” Novogratz said. “You see the psychology of fear and greed in the charts the same way you’d see it in charts of the Indonesian rupiah or dollar-yen or treasuries.

The accused, Ryan Kennedy, was arraigned at the Bristol crown court on September 11, The Sun reports.While there had been already many cases of Bitcoin scams for the past years, Kennedy's case is said to be unique in that it employed sophisticated strategies to trick victims worldwide. While details aren’t presently available due to the upcoming trial, Kennedy’s defense attorney, Dominic Thomas, states:""This is, as far as counsel are aware, the first trial of its kind.”Kennedy is charged with crimes from 2014 and is said to have stolen a total of £1 million in Bitcoin. This money was allegedly used to support a luxurious lifestyle.Finally, in June of this year, the Avon and Somerset police filed charges against Kennedy after three years of investigation by the Economic Crime Team. Included in the eight charges against Kennedy are money-laundering and fraudulent trading, which he denied in court on Monday.Thomas also added that the case is one of a kind and that evidence will be coming from all over the world, including Finland and America. As part of his alleged fraud, Kennedy apparently operated under different identities and even feigned being a lawyer with a degree from Balliol College, Oxford.The accused will have to go back to court for the case management hearing on December 18, and will stand trial on September 3, 2018.While this specific case may be unique,  it’s not the first time that Bitcoin-related crimes and thefts have occurred. Examples of such cases include a British model getting auctioned for Bitcoin and a man in Pennsylvania admitting to stealing $40 mln worth of Bitcoin. In fact, the man accused of the largest Bitcoin scam is set to be sentenced in January 2018.Bitcoin is becoming a favorite for hackers and criminals as a way to launder their money. Additionally, NYU and Google researchers think Bitcoin ransomware and hacking evolve into a billion-dollar business.Despite all the Bitcoin-related crimes, there is a good side to the digital currency as well. For example, there were cases where ethical Bitcoin users helped solve some of the FBI’s cases, including a murder case in early July 2017.",1
"BTC-e’s Vinnik Rejects US Judgment, Offers to Help Putin with Expertise",William Suberg,2017-09-11 16:20:00,17883,183,"Assumed BTC-e CEO Alexander Vinnik has publicly stated his innocence and even offered to help Vladimir Putin as a digital technology specialist.Speaking to Russia Today in his first official interview since police arrested him in Greece in July, Vinnik said he did not understand “what right” the US had to judge him as a Russian citizen.When asked why he had not voluntarily turned himself over to US authorities, Vinnik replied:“Because I do not think I’ve done anything to flout the law - that’s the first thing. Secondly, I don’t understand what relationship the US has to me and what right it has to judge a Russian citizen.”BTC-e shut down at the end of July citing technical difficulties. It subsequently became known that the FBI had liquidated 45 percent of its funds and that users would be issued refunds in the form of tokens and the remaining 55 percent of available capital.The reason for US interest was the alleged flouting of anti-money laundering laws, with Vinnik himself suspected of engaging in such activities.Continuing his defense, he said that US president Donald Trump should focus on his own matters while offering to help Russian president Putin in his field of expertise.“I’d tell [Putin] he needs specialists like me in the IT field, and that I could help him with that using my knowledge,” he added.The US is seeking fines of $110 mln from BTC-e and another $12 mln from Vinnik himself.",8
Equifax Hack: 3 Investors Sold $18 Mln Shares in Unclear Transaction,William Suberg,2017-09-08 14:15:00,20857,226,"Three Equifax investors sold $17.8 mln in shares days before the company announced it had suffered one of the biggest hacks in history.As Reuters reports Friday, the shares sold three days after Equifax knew of the hack, and it was as yet “not clear whether these transactions were part of a pre-arranged sales plan.”The credit giant has said that hackers gained entry to sensitive information from an unprecedented 143 mln accounts between May and July.Data such as names, social security and driver’s license numbers fell into the hands of malicious parties, along with 209,000 credit card numbers.Larger than any comparable attack in the US, Equifax is due to publish a report into the events in the coming weeks, while commentators highlight the vulnerability of centralized information storage.“On a scale of 1 to 10, this is a 10,” an analyst told Reuters.  “It affects the whole credit reporting system in the United States because nobody can recover it, everyone uses the same data.”Senate Select Committee on Intelligence vice-president Mike Warner went even further, describing the breach as “representing a real threat to the economic security of Americans.”Legacy infrastructure is becoming an increasingly difficult topic to avoid as hackers launch ever more sophisticated attacks affecting hundreds of businesses and other organizations at once.WannaCry, the Bitcoin ransomware attack which appeared in May, partly achieved its international success due to the inadequate and outdated software still used by prominent entities.",4
"What is Bitcoin, “Bubble Territory” or “New Gold”?",Darryn Pollock,2017-09-05 16:50:00,17504,275,"Jean Pierre Verster, who is well known for predicting the African Bank’s collapse, and is a portfolio manager at Fairtree Capital in South Africa, has come out in support of many who believe the latest rise in Bitcoin price is an indication of a bubble.The portfolio manager has said that Bitcoin is in bubble territory and that he will not be investing in it.In differentiating the value of Bitcoin compared to its founding technology, Vester has said the digital currency is a ‘false truth while the Blockchain technology on which it is built is a ‘true truth.’Verster is one in a long line of investors that have said they will not be investing in digital currencies, for a raft of different reasons. But it is clear that the portfolio manager still sees the value in Blockchain technology, but adds that Bitcoin is not a wise investment right now.Another portfolio manager, but this time at Ashburton Investments, Wayne McCurrie has said that he believes simply that Bitcoin is a digital version of gold.It is a common sentiment about the two commodities that are seen as stores of wealth, but also as a functioning, tradable commodities.Gold and Bitcoin are similar because they are independent currencies which no government can control, which you can carry around and get value for in any territory, he said.McCurrie, however, adds that gold’s establishment as a valuable commodity has been recognized for over 5,000 years, whereas Bitcoin has only been in existence for a couple of years at best.McCurrie’s prediction was that if Bitcoin was to make it big, and become a true success, it would have to become legislated.“Governments will never tolerate a separate monetary system outside of the formal banking system, so it will almost become illegal if it truly becomes big,” he said.Digital currencies, especially at the heights of Bitcoin, have lived fairly unhindered by government regulation. However, new ICO’s are suffering vicious attacks by governments, notably in China.The clampdown on ICOs is very different to the legislation that McCurrie is calling for, however, it may certainly also be aiding Bitcoin to gain legitimacy in a market that is being flooded by more and more digital currencies.",[]
Latin American Site with Bitcoin Tipping Hacked - 28 Mln User Accounts Compromised,Jon Buck,2017-09-05 02:55:00,19638,448,"Latin American social site Taringa, often called ‘Latin America’s Reddit’, has suffered a massive breach of user data. Login details for nearly all of the site’s users were compromised.The social site had instituted a system in 2015 to pay users for content production using Bitcoin. The site partnered with Xapo to create digital wallets for content producers, and then began funding them with Bitcoin for participation.Wallet balances of the individual users will likely be low, but the massive hack of data may well allow access to those wallets. With prices having increased dramatically since 2015, the original payments that remained intact are likely of some substantial value.Taringa was using an aging encryption system for passwords called MD5. The hackers were able to crack 95% of the 27 mln passwords within just a few days. Taringa has assured customers that wallet addresses were not compromised, though the surety of the promise remains in question. The information post says:""It is likely that the attackers have made the database containing nicks, email addresses and encrypted passwords. No phone numbers and access credentials from other social networks have been compromised as well as addresses of bitcoin wallets from the Taringa program!""Users should move Bitcoin balances into other wallets for protection, especially if they had used the same password for their wallet as for their Taringa account, a common practice.",1
Altcoin Founder Slams Need For ICOs After Alternative Experiment,Olusegun Ogundeji,2017-09-02 16:40:00,30552,450,"Initial coin offerings - or ICOs - are becoming increasingly important in today’s crypto scene but the founder of a coin which just rolled into the top 100 list on Coinmarketcap has proffered reasons why he thinks these crowdsale campaigns that aim to help startups lift their ideas from paper to reality are unnecessary.Basing his argument on the success of his coin thus far which now has about $40 mln market cap without an ICO, Ricardo Badoer of Aidos Kuneen (ADK) thinks most ICOs serve better to help developers fill their pockets fast. This view differs to those held by the schools of thought that ICO’s funding innovation helps draw the attention of many new users into the crypto fold, creates a reward for investors and contributes to making the ecosystem grow faster.“Well, for me, as it has been proven with many projects, the issue with ICOs is that dev teams fill their pockets fast and most of the time they do not even have working tech,” Badoer notes via Twitter:“‘Good’ ICOs just need hype, some well-known names in the crypto world and it can collect millions.”The Tangle-based ADK is now edging towards $5 even as there are claims that the project is working to bring in some banks into the offshore initiative. Badoer says it makes more sense for project creators to deliver a working technology to the market that investors can feel, touch and smell before deciding on whether they can invest in it or not. By so, he adds, crypto investments will not be based on white papers and fancy websites but on tested technology.He says:“Also, another part of ICO coins are that, as I did mention before, the fact that the tech that the coin is based on is not even complete. So why do they expect investors to invest based on their white papers and fancy websites? Most of the time you do not even know if the ICO will lead to the coin being traded. What good is a coin without an open market and half-finished tech without real life usage?”“It is like you wanting to buy a car. You go to a car dealership, and they give you a fancy brochure with pictures of the car, how it works, how fast it goes etc and they want you to give them the money. But they do not know when they will deliver the car. You would just think the car seller is crazy.”Just last week, the Chinese National Internet Finance Association said ICOs have shaken up social and economic order, created hidden financial risks and in some cases may amount to fraud as another form of an official concern about crowdfunding process. Hence, Caixin reports that Chinese regulators were preparing new rules on digital coin offerings and may ban them until the rules are in place.While Badoer admits that a well-planned ICO could bring enough profit, he also claims that the fact they are now too common is worrisome as some are scams which can “burn a lot of investors and this will or is hurting the crypto world. We do not get in ‘new’ money as they (investors) are scared of scams.”For Bashir Aminu, whose Cryptogene is launching an ICO later this month, many ICOs are in it for the cash as they just “write some fancy PDFs, create a shitty app that no one can use and call it a ""proof of concept."" Get some well-known peeps in the crypto space as advisors. And voila! Buy a Lambo.”Aminu notes:“This is no longer new, I've seen it happen over and over again. Most of these ICOs that raise 10s and 100s of millions can implement what they want to do with less than a million. But greed has blinded most of them as they're in it for the cash not because they want to solve any problems. Get a well-known figure to hype up your ICO for you, even if you have nothing to offer, and people will gladly give you millions for safe keeping. This is totally different from the approach we've taken at Cryptogene. We do not have any fancy advisors, or Cuckoo or Tim Draper. But we do have the passion and determination to succeed. This is some extremely hard work.”",13
$225 Million Lost As Cryptocurrency Investors Get Hooked by Phishing Scams,Guest Author,2017-08-26 15:55:00,17462,348,"Would-be cryptocurrency investors have been conned out of a combined $225 mln this year alone, according to a report released by Chainalysis, a provider of anti-money laundering software for Bitcoin.The hype surrounding cryptocurrencies has led to phishing attacks by cyber criminals increasing exponentially alongside the rise in ICO’s and digital token sales.These phishing attacks relate specifically to the ICO process and fool investors by redirecting them to a mirrored social media or web page that replicates the official ICO. Investors would then hand over their payment credentials, not knowing that, instead of investing in a new digital currency, they are funding yet another cyber-criminal.The result is that close to 30,000 individuals have lost on average $7,500 each and there’s about a one in ten chance of investors being redirected to fake ICO sites.The reason ordinarily web-savvy individuals fall for scams like these may lie in the time-sensitive nature of ICO’s. The limited opportunity within token sale events means investors tend to rush into early access trades, making them easy targets for phishing attacks.Although the most common, phishing is not the only tactic used by criminals to scam investors out of money. Back in 2016, a vulnerability in the DAO smart contract allowed hackers to steal $74 mln from 11,000 individuals.The good news is that the capabilities of developers to write more secure smart contracts are increasing and is reducing the frequency of theft through scams and system manipulation.The public landscape of the Blockchain also means that third parties are able to monitor trends in cryptocurrency usage. The data analysis can then be used to implement solutions that will safeguard these assets against malicious attacks.For cryptocurrency networks to continue to grow and remain sustainable, it is essential for solutions to be able to observe and glean information from specific networks.",1
"Enigma’s Hack: $500,000 of Ether Stolen, Accounts Compromised",John Patrick Mullin,2017-08-22 18:05:00,19386,385,"Enigma, a decentralized investment platform, has become the latest to fall victim to ICO hacking.In an ironic twist, after the hack of Coindash’s website during an ICO, Can Kigasun, co-founder and Chief Product officer even told Business Insider that Enigma has a simple solution that can prevent similar situations from happening in the future.To be exact, the Enigma platform wasn’t hacked, but rather the founder’s email and password were stolen, and then used to take over the company slack, website and the google account that was hosting the pre-sale form.The access has since been deactivated.In an even more compelling twist, the founder’s email and password were taken during the Ashley Madison hack, and he never ended up changing passwords.In fact, the company itself didn’t wind up losing any money in the attack.Once the attackers had access to the company’s  website and slack, they sent out messages to over 9,000 users.They changed the website with their BTC and ETH wallet address and made fake emails that included a community list, to make it look more official, and urged the users to send money to their personal wallet.The hackers made off with 1,492 in Ether coins, despite the warning Enigma issued previously to the community that it would not be collecting money in this manner prior to its ICO next month.IMPT: read the following info from Enigma re: recent scam attempt.

‘Hodlers’ Beware - Hackers Persuade Phone Companies to Hand Over Numbers,William Suberg,2017-08-22 12:38:00,16930,241,"Incidents of hackers convincing cellphone companies to hand over control of user numbers have increased 150 percent in three years.As cryptocurrency trader and investor Chris Burniske told the New York Times this week, the speed with which attackers compromise user devices with assumed links to virtual currency holdings is cause for great concern.“My iPad restarted, my phone restarted and my computer restarted, and that’s when I got the cold sweat and was like, ‘O.K., this is really serious,’”  he told the publication about the episode in 2016 which saw hackers drain $150,000 worth of coins.2,658 occurrences of theft via phone number came to light in January 2016, up from 1,038 the same month three years prior.Earlier this summer, users of Classic Ether Wallet suffered a similar fate after an attacker convinced its German ISP 1&1 to hand over control of the site’s domain.“It’s really highlighting the insecurity of using any kind of telephone-based security,” ShapeShift chief information security officer Michael Perklin added following multiple reports of its own users being affected.Cointelegraph reminds readers never to store cryptocurrency holdings in easily accessible format.

"HBO's $250,000 Bitcoin Parlay Fails as Hackers Continue Thefts",Darryn Pollock,2017-08-15 16:35:10,19239,285,"HBO says they are done playing games following a second hack that stole three more television shows. Hackers had initially stolen episodes of the popular “Game of Thrones” series, demanding a ransom of $6 mln. HBO instead offered a “goodwill” payment of $250,000 to the “Mr. Smith Hackers” in order to placate them.Apparently HBO’s ransom payment simply emboldened the hackers, as they have now reportedly stolen three more shows from the company. The latest shows to fall prey to the hackers are “Curb Your Enthusiasm,” “Ballers” and “Insecure.” Additionally, some episodes from yet-to-debut shows “Barry” and “The Deuce” were stolen.HBO recently commented on the matter, suggesting that the hackers may be more interested in attention than in money:“It has been widely reported that there was a cyber incident at HBO. The hacker may continue to drop bits and pieces of stolen information in an attempt to generate media attention. That’s a game we’re not going to participate in.”The news has been filled lately with reports of hackers holding data for ransom. Most of these incidents were due to the WannaCry and Petya malware. One such incident involved the UK’s  National Health Services, where patient data was encrypted by malware pending payment of a $300 ransom. In the wake of these attacks, many businesses in the UK have preemptively purchased Bitcoin in case they should need to pay a ransom to unlock time-sensitive files.Experts say the cyber thieves could have stolen even more sensitive data from HBO, including personal information of employees and other unaired episodes, which they may still be holding as leverage.Gartner analyst Avivah Litan explained:“It’s kind of like kidnap and ransom and torture...Eventually HBO may have to give in.”",2
"Tracing 66,000 Bitcoins: What We Should Learn From BTC-e Story",Iyke Aru,2017-08-14 20:10:00,20317,475,"Compliance-as-a-service company Coinfirm discusses the BTC-e situation and the 66,000 Bitcoins moved.According to Pawel Kuskowski, CEO & Co Founder at Coinfirm, right after the arrest of Alexander Vinnik, broadly referred to as the mastermind behind BTC-e, over 66,000 BTC were moved from 18f1yugoAJuXcHAbsuRVLQC9TezJ6iVRLp across the Bitcoin ecosystem.Vinnik himself is facing 21 charges from a US grand jury, mainly for money laundering but also computer hacking and drug trafficking.Lately the nefarious part of the cryptocurrency market took a big hit. It all started with a joint effort by law enforcement agencies from the U.S., Europe and Thailand to close two major dark net markets used mostly for the drug trade. Kuskowski notes that three days after the hack, BitMixer, the most popular Bitcoin mixing service announced their shut down effective immediately.Mixing services (mixers, tumblers, anonymizers) are services that are tools for potential mixing of illegal funds and are recognized by Europol and Interpol as illegal tools - their use could be treated as intentional anonymization of funds.In post on a bitcointalk forum, admins stated that they see the future of Bitcoin as more clean and legitimate than the dark net past. Moreover, it seems they realized that mixers became redundant in the wake of new Blockchain compliance and analytics solutions.BTC-e.com, one of the oldest cryptocurrency exchanges, was considered a golden standard of reliability. This may seem peculiar, considering the reputation of the exchange operating from Russia. It turns out that this stability might have been rooted in illicit operations that took place on the exchange as some took advantage of the exchange’s consciously permissive policies.Recent reports estimate that 95 percent of Bitcoin transactions resulting from ransomware attacks were cashed out through BTC-e, an exchange that was handling up to three percent of all Bitcoin traffic.Now BTC-e faces a $110 mln fine from Financial Crimes Enforcement Network for facilitating ransomware and dark net drug sales, and US authorities have seized the site’s domain.Note that ransomware is a criminal activity and helping with ‘anonymizing’ or ‘clearing funds’ from that source is considered money laundering and is a crime. We still can’t know if they’ll manage to get back in the game.Kuskowski tells Cointelegraph that shortly after the first tweet announcing the site’s unplanned maintenance, authorities confirmed that one of the central figures behind BTC-e, Alexander Vinnik was arrested in northern Greece and now faces accusations of leading a money laundering operation estimated at around $4 bln, and it is also presumed that Alexander took part in the MtGox hack.As a consequence, FinCEN assessed a civil penalty of $12 mln against Vinnik and if convicted he faces up to 55 years in prison.An additional moral to the story is that whether knowingly or not, not preventing your company or platform from laundering money from criminal operations or sources cannot only seriously threaten your business, but also your personal freedom.On July 27, 2017 Jamal El-Hindi, FinCEN’s Acting Director stated:“We will hold accountable foreign-located money transmitters, including virtual currency exchangers, that do business in the United States when they willfully violate U.S. anti-money laundering laws. This action should be a strong deterrent to anyone who thinks that they can facilitate ransomware, dark net drug sales, or conduct other illicit activity using encrypted virtual currency. Treasury’s FinCEN team and our law enforcement partners will work with foreign counterparts across the globe to appropriately oversee virtual currency exchangers and administrators who attempt to subvert U.S. law and avoid complying with U.S. AML safeguards.”  Kuskowski reveals that approximately two hours after the first tweet from BTC-e over 66,000 Bitcoins were moved from 18f1yugoAJuXcHAbsuRVLQC9TezJ6iVRLp Bitcoin address through a couple thousand intermediating addresses.He notes that Coinfirm used their Blockchain AML & Analytics Platform that streamlines and automates AML and compliance for Blockchain, to trace the transaction.This case sets a new era for Blockchain as one of the oldest exchanges was directly tied to illegal activities, and suggests that implementing AML analysis tools in exchanges and all crypto-related businesses is a necessity as the ecosystem moves forward.Also, it highlights that regardless of where you are - AML/CFT rules need to be followed. Such events mixed with new solutions in the market is moving the whole Blockchain ecosystem further towards commercial and mass adoption, revealing the undisputed benefits it holds to a much wider scope of users and businesses.Last January, Chris Skinner met with Kuskowski to discuss Blockchain and the future of Compliance. In a Laundering-as-a-service blogpost that resulted from that meeting, it reads that 98 percent of an estimated $1.6 trillion of global money laundering goes through the nets in the traditional financial system.It turns out that the traditional finance system’s reliance on intermediaries and central authorities might be more prone to mismanagement, than fully decentralized, automated and auditable systems based on Blockchain and solutions that aren’t focused on investigation, but providing data to prevent being tied to financial crimes.As would be the case with any functional unregulated value exchange system, Bitcoin was partially adopted by people who wanted to escape financial oversight. This made Bitcoin adoption a harder case especially for commercial entities.Sometimes inaccurately praised for alleged anonymity, companies and financial institutions around the world became wary about adopting the world-changing innovation, and potential clients who are using it, do so mainly due to compliance and regulatory fears. Now it turns out that the tides have turned for the overall good.With Compliance-as-a-service solutions for Blockchain-based systems, we stand on the verge of a system with the potential to nearly eradicate money laundering and provide a new era of honesty and transparency in the financial system.This case proves that compliance for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies is not only possible, but can become a layer for both Blockchain and traditional systems that enables the next generation of efficiency, transparency, and security for users and companies globally.Functionalities, and the infrastructure offered by the maturing Blockchain ecosystem are unparalleled, and with the compliance hurdles deemed as the largest roadblock for cryptocurrency and Blockchain mass adoption being solved, it may give rise to a new era of compliance overall.What used to be a large cost and labor drain for all parties involved, can now be automated and streamlined to the point where it no longer becomes a major burden, and opens up the possibility for smaller and disruptive players to enter the market and interact with companies and individuals globally.",10
London Police Shut Down Scam Crypto Call Centre Based Next to Bank of England,Darryn Pollock,2017-08-14 11:08:09,11469,621,"A call centre in the middle of London, purporting to sell fake digital currencies, has been shut down by the City’s police.Having set up their ‘boiler room’ in the City's famous square mile, on Old Broad Street, which is around the corner from the Bank of England, the fraudsters would cold call potential investors in hopes of enticing them to invest in the boom of digital currencies.The police have held a suspect who is accused of trying to entice victims to invest in a fictional cryptocurrency.The police say:""Victims were cold called by salespeople who allegedly persuaded them to invest in a cryptocurrency that does not exist and is therefore worthless.”It is believed that the fraudsters were successful, and lucrative, as they were reported by nine victims to Action Fraud after losing an estimated £160,000 in total.The boom of cryptocurrencies, especially buoyed by Bitcoin’s astronomic growth recently, as well as ICO’s breaking records for fundraising and growth, has seen many parties have their interest piqued.Digital currencies are still somewhat mysterious to the average person in the street with there being lots of questions over buying digital currencies. The fraudsters preyed on this interest and confusion in their cold calls.Police got involved in investigating this operation when a number of people reported the boiler room to the UK's consumer fraud and cyber crime watchdog Action Fraud.  ""Investment fraudsters are still targeting people throughout the country (and other countries, such as China) and they employ aggressive sales tactics which are often used to pressurise unsuspecting victims into parting with large sums of money,"" said Mark Forster, detective inspector at the City of London Police.""These people often base themselves in the City as they believe having an address in a prestigious financial district will help to legitimise their fraud.""",2

Prosecutors in Germany opened up criminal investigations into the company and in Hungary the government also took steps to tackle the ponzi scheme.Italy’s AGCM has been working hard at shutting down OneCoin's influence in the country as its investigation was based on its suspicion that the currency was a “deceitful Ponzi scheme”.The investigation wrapped up in February with OneCoin contesting the results, but regardless, the digital currency was banned in Italy at the end of February.OneCoin was required to respond to the AGCM with a detailed plan as to what measures it would take to stop all promotion of its company within Italy’s borders, or face a fine.When there was no response from the ponzi scheme, the AGCM announced that they would incur a fine of between €10,000 to €5 mln. As such, the fine has now been set at €2.5 mln based on findings that OneCoin is a “pyramid sales system” that sold “one coins” to the general public.While OneCoin has faced many bans and measures to stop its functioning in different states, the monetary fine imposed by Italy seems to be the first of its kind.",19
"Twice-Hacked HBO Offers $250,000 to Mr. Smith Attackers",William Suberg,2017-08-11 12:16:32,10326,136,"Hacked TV giant HBO has offered a “goodwill” payment of $250,000 to ‘Mr. Smith’ attackers threatening to publish more classified material.Details of correspondence four days after the initial hack began on July 23 shows an executive suggesting the offer, which was considerably below the hackers’ demands of $6 mln in Bitcoin.As Deadline reports quoting anonymous sources, the offer is genuine, contrary to others surfacing from alternative correspondence between HBO and the malicious party.Comparisons are being drawn between HBO, which has seen items such as Game of Thrones script information leaked, and other high-profile entertainment hacks such as Sony in 2014 and more recently Netflix.Unlike Sony, however, the amount of information in play from HBO appears to be both much smaller and much less significant.“If they [the hackers] had something they would have put it out there by now like what happened with Netflix,” an “industry insider” told Deadline.“Either they didn’t get far, there wasn’t a lot to get or what they got is in too many pieces to add up to much.”The network has further stated it didn’t think its email system had been “compromised” this month despite “at least month’s worth of executives’ emails” became public, Fortune writes Thursday.",[]
"Digital Currency Scam in China Involved 47,000 People",Willie Tan,2017-08-10 11:54:00,12557,273,"On January 2017, Hainan City Police Department addressed the public on the issue of a huge scam purported by a company called ‘HaiNan KuaYaOu Private Limited.’The company operated a web-based business dealing digital currency named ‘Asian-European Currency.’Suspect, Xu, registered the company at Hainan City Commerce Department. In the registration, the company stated that its main business involves dealing virtual currency online.Under the guise of a legally registered company, it conducted a get-rich-quick scheme operated in the form of a multilayer marketing program which promised investors high returns.The process of trading the fraudulent currency involved joining an ‘Inner Circle’ where new traders were introduced by ‘dealers.’New trading members were required to purchase at least 10,000 RMB worth of the digital currency. Upon purchase, the amount was frozen for 250 days after which it can be traded and cashed at the ‘Outer Circle.’The currency was set to increase its value every 10 days in the ‘Inner Circle.’ The ‘Outer Circle’ served as a platform for trading the currency, where its value was increased drastically to attract more traders.In the inner circle of the multi-level marketing arrangement, the money that was used to purchase the fraudulent currency was transferred to the provincial ‘dealers’ accounts, which in turn was transferred to the personal accounts of the top leveled members of the company.The company had organized many seminars and forums in luxurious hotels across China to convince the public to invest.It falsely claimed that it belongs to the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council (SASAC).Besides, marketing was also done through Chinese social media. A strong purported background, high investment return and strong marketing strategy were the strong factors for the scam to be wildly successful.On April 24, 2017, police have taken legal action against the representatives and CEO of the company, Xia JianRong and Liu Lang among others.

"ICO Investors, Beware - There is Thin Line Between Hacks and Scams: Opinion",Guest Author,2017-08-02 18:12:00,8345,169,"The consensus in the crypto community is that there are a lot of scammy ICOs out there. The obvious ones who make fun of the market aren’t the problem. Those who deliberately try and cheat people of their money are.The fear of missing out is strong, but people need to start waking up because most of these teams will never be able to deliver upon their great promises.Last week’s guidelines from the SEC will hopefully be a first step in making life harder for dishonest teams. However, these are some of the red flags you should still look out for before investing:If you spot any of these signs, hold on to your ETH for dear life.Over the past few weeks, we have seen several cases of alleged hacks against ICOs. Some of these were definitely legit hacks that lead to theft of ICO funds, like the attack against the Parity wallet software (that’s right, the Ethereum protocol wasn’t hacked, a dapp sitting on top of it was). The attack exploited a bug which allowed the thief to first obtain ownership of other people’s multisig wallets and then move its funds.The Parity team has confirmed the bug and are taking steps to prevent any other critical errors from making it through to release. Most importantly, an explanation was given to the public, including data and technical details of what happened. No reason to suspect any of the involved parties of shady dealings here.Other “hacks” seem less obvious. A couple of recent cases have seen the ICO teams reporting the theft of donated funds, followed by less than satisfactory explanations as to how the hack took place. The information given has been vague, some would even say indistinguishable from an exit scam.If you really were hacked, why would you not want to disclose the full details as to how it went down? And if your loss of funds was a result of human stupidity, say so, don't leave people guessing and creating conspiracy theories about greed and inside jobs. An opaque process will only hurt your project and the community,Disappointingly, there was no questioning of the veracity of the stories. This at a time when we should demand proof and hard data, not just accept some vague dismissal from the team about having reported the hackers and refusing to share further details. Just because the ICO market has been labeled “the New Wild West of Investing” doesn't mean we should let people get away with anything.Simply blaming these incidents on immature technology and demanding that security is improved, before you understand the project in question and how the alleged hack took place, is not good enough. That only contributes to spreading fear, uncertainty and doubt.How about this for a business model: 1. Do ICO, (1b. Short your own token,) 2. Get “hacked,” 3. Profit (thanks to Reddit user Dmitriyy).Because really, what is to stop the founders of a dishonest project from staging their own hack? For some of these teams, there is a thin line between raising funds and plain greed.Thus, it is important to challenge the business models of the ICO projects and scrutinize the teams. There are probably more scammers out there right now than there are hackers.Even though ICOs, primarily the Ethereum ones, are getting a lot of heat at the moment, the chances are good that some of these projects are going to be the ones that eventually bring Blockchain technology and crypto across the chasm. Investors and media need to up their game a little to make sure the scammy ones get what they deserve.- By Trond Vidar BjorøyTrond Vidar Bjorøy is a corporate travel tech geek, crypto enthusiast, and blogger.

Bitcoin Store Operator Lost Investors $40 mln: Reports,William Suberg,2017-08-02 13:56:00,8246,217,"Investors in fraudulent Bitcoin exchange operator Renwick Haddow’s businesses are coming forward as losses worth millions of dollars surface.As United Arab Emirates news resource The National reports Tuesday, those who contributed funds to Haddow’s schemes have all but lost everything.Haddow is now in police custody after Interpol issued a warrant for his arrest last week. Police found him in Morocco after the US Securities and Exchange Commission said he had committed securities fraud.“So many others have fallen into this trap,” Kamal Singh, who took out a bank loan worth $90,000 to invest in Haddow’s Bar Works project told the publication. “We only knew of the involvement of Renwick Haddow after the problems started.”Haddow had purported to run a cryptocurrency exchange under the name of Bitcoin Store. According to the SEC, the business never became “profitable,” with investor funds being diverted elsewhere.From its genesis in 2015, the ‘exchange’ had only received $250,000 in inbound transfers.Bar Works meanwhile illicitly sold work space to residents in countries all over the world, including the US, Singapore and Turkey.In total, Haddow is suspected of conning victims out of more than $40 mln.",[]
New Jersey Resident Who Sold Fake Licenses For Bitcoins Sentenced,Joshua Althauser,2017-07-29 13:26:00,4626,111,"US federal court judge, Jose Linares, has decided a five-year prison term against Jersey City resident Ricardo Rosario for his involvement in a fake driver’s license and tax refund schemes. In his ruling, Linares also ordered Rosario to return over $350,000 and serve three years of supervised release.Rosario and his cohorts were involved in two separate schemes involving the sale of custom-made high-quality fake identification documents on the Internet and the fraudulent collection of tax refund checks.The fake licenses were utilized in “cash-out” schemes in which stolen credit card data were encoded to forged credit cards to steal cash from the accounts of the victims.Buyers of the fake licenses used Bitcoin or MoneyPak, a prepaid payment card that is usually purchased at retail stores, in their transactions to avoid detection.According to authorities, Rosario established and operated a website that was available at “fakeidstore.com” and “fakedlstore.com” to sell fake driver’s licenses. His cohorts, Abraham Corcino and Alexis Scott Carthens, were responsible for producing and mailing the fake licenses that were bought through the website. The website allegedly implemented the “No refunds. No snitching” rule to its users.The website had allegedly charged around $150 per fake license. It also offered a bulk pricing package for orders of 10 or more licenses.The group operated their schemes for two years beginning in October 2012 in the states of New Jersey, Florida, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Illinois.Meanwhile, Rosario’s partner Corcino has already received a sentence of three years of probation in early 2017. Carthens, on the other hand, is scheduled for sentencing on Sep. 28, 2017.",[]

Calamari added.Cointelegraph previously reported on Haddow’s original arrest earlier this month, and Moroccan authorities are now set to consider his extradition.It is a second high-profile Bitcoin case to surface involving the SEC this week, with the regulator also seeking $110 mln in anti-money laundering fines against Russian exchange BTC-e.Its assumed founder, Alexander Vinnik, is also under pressure to pay a personal fine of $12 mln.",1
Greek Police Arrest Man Who Laundered $4 bln in Bitcoin Over 6 Years,William Suberg,2017-07-26 18:05:00,23658,291,"The largest Russian-language cryptocurrency exchange BTC-e was closed on ""unscheduled technical work.""The owners of BTC-e diligently kept anonymity. However, our source from qugla.com ICO marketing agency has revealed to Cointelegraph that Alexander Vinnik is one of the owners and administrators of the exchange.Earlier today, Greek police have arrested Alexander Vinnik accused of heading a group which laundered $4 bln in Bitcoin over six years.“There was practically no KYC on the exchange, and, as a result, the cash flows were unregulated,” the source explains.“The reason why Vinnik has been caught only now is relatively simple - SEC is tightening the screws, and in November there will be a new law in the US regulating token sale.”There is no reliable information, but in the opinion of our source, the funds are in the hands of the second administrator of BTC-e who is now actively negotiating with SEC and the Ministry of Justice.“If within 48 hours the situation is not resolved in a positive way, with a high degree of probability you can forget about the money.”BTC-e invested in a lot of cryptocurrency startups as well as exchanges.As the source confirms, Vinnik has a direct relationship to hacking MtGox. The hacked Bitcoins were not only laundered by BTC-e but also were on Vinnik's personal wallet. The total amount is about 300 000 BTC. In the same manner, they laundered stolen BTC from other exchanges.“He was singled out through WebMoney - there was a connection with his wm-exchanger service”, explains the source. “He caught the interest of the police in their investigation of MtGox”.“Sasha is an outstanding person, the cleverest of people, according to those who know him. He could multiply three-digit numbers mentally. He is very calculating. He had no equal for reasoning. He was always one step ahead of competitors and authorities.”The arrest warrant was originally issued by the US Ministry of Justice and relates to activities involving the use of Bitcoin stretching back to 2011.“We can confirm a Russian citizen was arrested yesterday (July 25) on the orders of the US Ministry of Justice,” a source from the Russian general consulate in Thessaloniki told RBC. “His detention is not yet finalized and for now he is simply under arrest.”A raid on the 38-year-old’s hotel room produced multiple computers, phones and credit cards, Mail.ru further reports.Details of the scheme are yet to emerge, but it is by far not the first incident of Bitcoin-related transactions leading to arrests and international headlines from the US.Operating money transfer businesses without a license has frequently formed the motivation for jail sentences in recent years as informal Bitcoin trading goes awry.",6
Dark Web Market AlphaBay Shut Down by US Authorities,Joshua Althauser,2017-07-26 07:55:00,10573,145,"Famous dark web market AlphaBay has been shut down by the US government.The US Department of Justice on Thursday confirmed that they have shut down the black market and captured AlphaBay’s operator. It was in early July through a combined operation by the US and European authorities that the founder and operator of AlphaBay, Alexandre Cazes, was arrested causing AlphaBay to shut down.Rob Wainwright, the Executive Director of Europol said:""This is an outstanding success by authorities in Europe and the US.  The capability of drug traffickers and other serious criminals around the world has taken a serious hit today after a highly sophisticated joint action in multiple countries.”The 25-year old Canadian Alexandre Cazes known as the founder of the dark website AlphaBay was arrested in Bangkok Thailand. However, shortly after he was arrested, Cazes committed suicide inside his jail cell. He was found dead hanging in a towel on the ceiling of his cell.Before it was taken down, AlphaBay was known as the biggest drug market place and bazaar on the dark web. It hosted more than 40,000 vendors of drugs which transacted to some 200,000 clients.Apart from drugs like fentanyl and heroin, AlphaBay was also used to trade in weapons and malware according to the law enforcers along with a series of Bitcoin-related heists.Aside from AlphaBay, another dark web market was also taken down by the authorities. Hansa Market was taken over by the authorities last June wherein two men were arrested and accused of operating the dark web marketplace.Before AlphaBay and Hansa, there was Silk Road.Silk Road was the first modern dark web marketplace selling illegal drugs. It was launched in February 2011 but was shut down by the authorities in October 2013 following the arrest of its founder Ross Ulbricht.Since virtual currencies are used to transact in dark web marketplace, shutting down of AlphaBay and Hansa may have effects of virtual currencies.Several months ago, AlphaBay was supposed to list ZEC in July. However, with AlphaBay now shut down, the digital currency wasn’t able to have a proper kickstart.",1
Hacker Demands Bitcoin From Jared Kushner to Keep Trump’s Tax Returns Secret,Darryn Pollock,2017-07-25 10:38:00,7995,177,"Jared Kushner, answering questions about his collusion with the Russians, has said he was demanded in an email, from “Guccifer 400” to pay a ransom of 52 Bitcoins or US President Donald Trump’s controversial tax returns would be released.Guccifer 400 appears to be an apparent homage to Guccifer 2.0, the malicious hacker or group that intelligence chiefs have fingered as an attribution front for the GRU, Russia’s military intelligence directorate - though, not wholly convincingly.It turned out to be a bit of an empty threat as Kushner, who first perceived the email to be a hoax, did not act on the demand and Trump’s taxes were never released.The President’s son-in-law, under the instruction of the secret service, informed the message and did not reply in any manner.“On Oct. 30, 2016, I received a random email from the screen name “Guccifer400,” Kushner said. “This email, which I interpreted as a hoax, was an extortion attempt and threatened to reveal candidate Trump’s tax returns and demanded that we send him 52 Bitcoin in exchange for not publishing that information.”He continued:“I brought the email to the attention of the US Secret Service agent on the plane we were all traveling on and asked what he thought. He advised me to ignore it and not to reply—which is what I did. The sender never contacted me again.”It doesn't seem plausible that this email came from the notorious Guccifer, nor the 2.0 version as both those hackers have been at the front of some pretty serious hacks and information leaks.Guccifer 2.0 is another homage, to the original who was a 40-something Romanian hacker called Marcel Lazăr Lehel.Lehel was the one who hacked Sidney Blumenthal, a Hillary Clinton confidant and former aide to President Bill Clinton. The hacker was arrested by Romanian authorities in early 2014.     The 2.0 version has been tied to  Roger Stone, a longtime Trump confidant and political operative who appeared to have foreknowledge about leaked Democratic party emails before their publication by WikiLeaks last year.",1
Scammer Steals $1 Mln Worth of Bitcoin in 14 Months from Alphabay Users,Lisa Froelings,2017-07-22 14:40:00,18369,292,"A darknet phisher hiding in the pseudonym ‘Phishkingz’ has boasted that he has stolen more than $1 mln worth of the digital currency Bitcoin from phishing accounts from the darknet marketplace AlphaBay in the past 14 months as of mid-2017.The deep web hacker said that he is also a dark market vendor and has traded around 500 Bitcoin on the LocalBitcoins site during the period.According to Phishkingz, he has decided to begin phishing AlphaBay accounts to steal Bitcoins following his discovery of a flaw on the site’s forums that allowed him to monitor new members the moment they joined the site.He then directly contacted the members and sent them a verification process to redirect them to his link. The phisher, then, was able to get the members’ various data including their login details syncing, PGP private keys, passwords, pin codes and their mnemonic phrases.Using Blockchain.info to save a bookmark on the members’ data, he would check for deposits every 20 minutes. He claimed that he processed the majority of the withdrawals of the deposits manually.He also said that at one point, his phishing activities have grown considerably that he employed 27 individuals to steal Bitcoins for him.Phishkingz also claimed that he was successful in his crime due to the little support given by AlphaBay’s moderators to its users:“The admins didn’t really care about their customers, and it only took opening a support ticket with a problem to learn this. BM (Big Muscles an AlphaBay moderator) especially is a stupid one. He would let me into accounts for 50 percent if I provided mnemonic phrase knowing I had phished the account in the first place.”International law enforcement agents recently shuttered the AlphaBay marketplace.",1

OneCoin IS Much Ponzi: Indian Police Chief Confirms ‘Clear Ponzi Scheme’,William Suberg,2017-07-12 10:56:00,15859,724,"Indian police have said OneCoin is a “clear Ponzi scheme” as they prepare to charge original figurehead Ruja Ignatova and others.In reports relayed by local news source Indian Express, Tushar Doshi, Deputy Commissioner of Police in Mumbai, said that so far 23 people were arrested in connection with OneCoin operations in India.“In this sort of scheme, investors become the perpetrators as well as victims. It is clear that this is a Ponzi scheme,” he told the publication.Doshi’s comments are the most direct suggestion yet from official sources that OneCoin is a Ponzi scheme, the outfit forcefully denying previous accusations alleging the same.In April, police arrested participants in a seminar propagating OneCoin to potential investors, with bank accounts coming under suspicion and holdings totaling $5 mln at the time seized.A total of 35 bank accounts are now under investigation, Indian Express reports, with the total sums involved amounting to 750 mln rupees ($11.6 mln).Increasing legal scrutiny on OneCoin meanwhile continues to surface from countries around the world, most recently in Vietnam after the company’s purported license to operate in the country appeared to be a forgery.It remains to be seen to what extent India will implicate Ignatova in its ongoing investigation.",17
Wolf of Mt. Gox Mark Karpeles Faces Music in Tokyo,Darryn Pollock,2017-07-10 15:20:00,12310,170,"The biggest and most notorious Bitcoin exchange hack will be scrutinized in a Tokyo court this week as Mt.Gox’s Mark Karpeles is brought before the law to answer charges of embezzlement and data manipulation.“He is keeping calm as the trial gets under way,"" his lawyer Kiichi Lino said, also stating that Karpeles plans to plead not guilty.A total of $480 mln dollars was emptied from the digital coffers of the then largest digital currency exchange in the world. Up to about 80 percent of all Bitcoin action came and went through Mt. Gox’s doors, but, in 2014, the exchange was shut down after having to admit that 850,000 coins had gone missing.At first, the explanation given was that there was a bug in the software that allowed hackers into the exchange that saw them walk off with millions of dollars from the Mt.Gox user base.Karpeles, who at his peak, was living large as the head of the most successful Bitcoin exchange, was arrested twice in 2015 for embezzlement, but he was released on bail and has been awaiting trial since then.Karpeles was renowned for living large, staying in a $11,000 per month penthouse and reportedly spending money with reckless abandon, including on prostitutesMt. Gox soon filed for bankruptcy after this major scandal to try and protect themselves from a slew of angry investors and customers. The effect of this misappropriation of funds left a huge dent in the confidence of digital currencies and saw a crash in its price.Following the pressure and demands for the return of funds to customers, Karpeles came forward and said he had found some of the missing coins on a cold storage device, 200,000 in all.Unfortunately, the focus on the trial will not resolve all the issues that have arisen from the disappearance of the funds, in fact, it will do very little to aid those affected by the disappearance.Kolin Burges, and investor from Britain that was stung by the Mt.Gox hack, admits that the trial is the right thing, but probably won’t ease those who were at ground zero.""The charges only cover a subset of the issues which were happening at MtGox, so I don’t expect that we will find out most of the information we want to know.”“I’ve not had any back yet, but hopefully, eventually all the creditors will get a small percentage of their money back from the bankruptcy distribution,"" Burges said.Karpeles has been implicated in hacking and price manipulation before. In 2010, after writing in a blog his aversion to cybercrime, the Mt. Gox CEO was sentenced in a Paris court to a year in prison in absentia for hacking. He was currently living Tokyo and involved in Bitcoin at the time.",[]

Not Exit Scam?

In various online communities including Reddit, AlphaBay moderators wrote:“AlphaBay is currently down. We are waiting for updates from AB admins. Don’t panic and don’t post any more threads telling that AlphaBay is down. Don’t get phished or scammed by fake vendors offering you direct deals. Wait patiently until we hear official updates from the staff rather than speculate.”More to that, AlphaBay moderators noted that the AlphaBay platform would be restored soon. The platform went through various server updates and security updates in order to keep customer funds and the entire platform safe.Another AlphaBay moderator wrote:“I have been in touch with our developers and admins and they are working to restore AlphaBay as soon as possible. As I have said before, during downtimes, there are added risks that you should understand and be weary of.”In total, AlphaBay experienced a 27-hour downtime. However, both the community and developers of AlphaBay stated that the recovery of the platform and fixes for security flaws would make the AlphaBay platform more resilient to security issues in the future.As previous Cointelegraph reports emphasized, it is not a viable option to store Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrencies on centralized and custodial platforms. Although users or vendors on AlphaBay could have been storing Bitcoin on the platform in order to execute deals and process payments more efficiently, for security purposes, it is never safe to store Bitcoin on custodial platforms.For instance, the July 5 server downtime of AlphaBay could have locked customer funds for an indefinite amount of time. The moderators of AlphaBay did not immediately provide the community with an official announcement until various Reddit threads emerged, criticizing the platform and raising the possibility of an exit scam being executed by AlphaBay.At the moment, users can be assured that their funds are safe, as said by the moderators of AlphaBay.",5

After all, the site states that they mine the Bitcoins so that you win in the long run,” Players Money continues, adding that it found “major red flags” while assessing the now-defunct website.As recently as a week ago, however, Ecoin Plus was uploading promotional material in which various “users” reported receiving thousands of dollars in dividends.Cointelegraph reminds readers to always thoroughly research purported investment opportunities prior to sending any funds.

Two US Army Guardsmen Charged and Convicted for Bitcoin Fraud,Anthony Coggine,2017-06-12 22:54:00,17591,350,"On May 23, 2016, two members of the US Army National Guard were convicted of running an intricate credit card scheme through the means of Bitcoins. Other three Guardsmen – Derrick Shelton, Quentin Stewart, and Jamal Moody – pleaded guilty for wire fraud, aggravated identity theft, and conspiracy to commit access device fraud.On June 2, the two indicted persons, James Stewart and Vincent Grant, were caught red-handed using Bitcoins in purchasing stolen credit and debit card numbers. They bought the credit cards from a number of foreign websites. The Justice Department records reveal that Stewart and Grant were also prosecuted last year.The perpetrators successfully skimmed credit card information by using advanced magnetic strip tools. The numbers were then transferred to dummy cards which were used to purchase merchandise from Army and Air Force Exchange Service stores stationed at various US military bases. Apparently, the duo also bought items from other locations all over Maryland.Stewart was found guilty on charges of wire fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and aggravated identity theft. Grant, on the other hand, was convicted for conspiracy to commit access device fraud and also aggravated identity theft. Overall, five members of the US Army National Guard were arrested and charged.James, Shelton, and Quentin will face a maximum of 20 years imprisonment, while Grant and Moody are heading on to a maximum of seven-and-half year sentence. All of the five suspects involved will also face a mandatory imprisonment of two years minimum for aggravated identity theft.Even though Bitcoin is known as a dynamic cryptocurrency, key lapses in its blockchain data enabled the frauds committed by the indicted Guardsmen. With the prevalence of such crime, many experts are certain that blockchain platforms will have stricter, anti-fraud systems. Since many ‘Bitcoin frauds’ are still operational, heightened vigilance is needed by Bitcoin owners whenever doing transactions online.",2
GAW Miners Creator Josh Garza Fined $12 mln For “Ponzi Scheme”,William Suberg,2017-06-06 13:50:00,9334,211,"Former GAW Miners creator Josh Garza faces a $12 mln fine for running what lawmakers have certified was a “Ponzi scheme.”Garza, who was charged with securities fraud in 2015 and is also facing separate criminal proceedings for running the fraudulent mining operation, received a final judgment from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on June 2.“According to the SEC's complaint, GAW Miners and ZenMiner did not own enough computing power for the mining they promised to conduct, so most investors paid for a share of computing power that never existed,” the official filing reads.“Returns allegedly paid to some investors came from proceeds generated from sales to other investors.”GAW Miners and sister scheme Paycoin attracted widespread accusations while it was active during 2014, despite Garza’s persistent efforts to denounce what he considered defamatory propaganda on the part of users, commentators and the media.A ruling is yet to be made on what should happen to the Bitcoin funds collected by Garza and his associates, with the virtual currency’s price having markedly increased in the intervening period.The penalty specifically takes the form of “$10,384,099 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest.

"With Scammers Capitalizing On Altcoins Surge, How to Spot New Ponzi Schemes?",Iyke Aru,2017-05-17 12:50:00,23360,591,"The activities of scammers within the cryptocurrency industry is on the increase. It is suggested that the increased popularity of Bitcoin and other altcoins such as Ripple, Ethereum and Litecoin may have stirred up some genuine curiosity in the faculties of newbies and other hopefuls around the crypto ecosystem. It is this growing curiosity that is milked by con artists who take advantage of the ignorance of their victims.When it comes to disruptive technology, knowledge isn’t just power, knowledge is everything.The right knowledge about any given innovation will always offer genuine and sustainable benefits. On the contrary, a distorted idea of any given technology will not only be misleading, but it remains a metaphorical time bomb that will eventually explode when the time comes.""In as much as Blockchain and the Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) offers a huge platform for various kinds of innovations and investments, the promise of unrealistic returns on investment is a common characteristic that cuts across almost all cryptocurrency scams.""Hiding behind the veil of crypto related activities, a lot of Ponzi schemes have succeeded in enticing many unsuspecting participants.One common characteristic of these setups is their ambiguous way of explaining their processes. They always flinch when confronted with direct questions and the quest for appropriate details of their investment schemes.The basic life-cycle of every pyramid scheme is dependent on its ability to keep recruiting new members.In other words, pyramid schemes can be regarded as Ponzis, where the investments of new recruits are used to pay existing participants.Therefore, as soon as the rate of recruitment falls below a certain level, the system becomes unsustainable and a lot of people will end up losing their investment.Bob Wood, CEO at Nexxus Partners, tells Cointelegraph that cryptocurrency scams abound from the perfect storm of a major disruptive technology and the uninformed public. Wood explains how the average non-technical person can identify these scams early on. Look at:Who are the people behind the cryptocurrency? Are they trustworthy and competent? Are their names and resumes published for the public to review? Do they have a Google trail of promoting other scams? Do they have an experienced technology team behind the cryptocurrency? These are some of the questions that should be clarified by an investor towards any given prospective venture.For entities that are out to promote a given cryptocurrency, questions should be asked about how they are creating value with their cryptocurrency? Are they providing retail products or services as a value to the marketplace to generate a profit? Why would anyone buy and use their cryptocurrency? What user benefit will be derived, outside of speculative trading?Every investor should be wary of claims of receiving an unusually high and fast return on investment. Some scams claim 1-2 percent of daily earnings or 100 percent monthly earnings. Obviously, too-good-to-be-true, but it hypnotizes the greedy into irrational thinking. The reality is that all or most of the returns on investment are being paid from new investors money (i.e. Ponzi scheme), that always collapse eventually.Acclaimed methods for creating profits must be properly scrutinized. Profits from mining Bitcoins is a common claim that is fallacious due to the very competitive mining environment. Another claim is arbitrage, which is the ability to buy low on one public exchange and sell high on another. There is nowhere near the volume of opportunity to satisfy the promised profits. Finally, be wary of claims of widespread acceptance by merchants. When merchants accept a coin they typically have to sell the coin to pay their bills, which drops the coin price not increase it.Wood concludes by noting that the best way for people to protect themselves from cryptocurrency scams is to invest in education to become knowledgeable about the potential and virtues of cryptocurrency.",3

He insists that his claims remain legitimate and are based on critical circumstances related to the business that OneCoin Ltd conducts.While maintaining that Bjercke’s legitimate actions cannot cause OneCoin any financial or further reputational loss of any kind, Bjerke’s legal response seeks answers from OneCoin. The following questions were asked:Where is the company OneCoin Ltd registered?Who is the company’s board?Who are the company’s directors?What is the company’s address?What is the company’s organization number?The letter comes amidst several events that has seen some key players and partners of OneCoin appear to be self-contradicting in their communications.A classic case is that of the CEO of DX Markets, Marcelo Garcia Casil who made public a letter refuting statements that questions the existing technological capabilities supporting OneCoin attributed to him.In his letter, Casil says:“I refute any allegations that I had not seen the existing system nor have I questioned the competence of OneCoin’s existing arrangements to satisfy the current needs of the cryptocurrency.”However, shortly after Casil’s letter was made public there appeared a screenshot of a Twitter conversation where he was seen to have earlier retained and opinion that contradicts his position as contained in his letter.Developing events suggest that we are yet to see the end of the battles of OneCoin as the triangle of hosts, investors and opponents continue in their respective struggle for interest, hope and salvation for the people.",9

The Magyar Nemzeti Bank (MNB), the country's central bank, announced that it is part of a wide-ranging task force aimed at cracking down on ""certain elements of the alleged pyramid scheme.""In an earlier publication on Cointelegraph, OneCoin was reported to have resolved to media intimidation as a fight-back mechanism. However, such move only seems to have had a counterproductive effect as more media personnel have teamed up to resist the attack and in the process improve on efforts of sensitizing the public and providing support to victims of the alleged scam.The Blockchain specialist, and major target of OneCoin’s intended legal intimidation, Bjorn Bjercke tells Cointelegraph that the tempo is high at the moment towards delivering the public from the claws of OneCoin.Bjercke says:“A lot is happening already, especially in Europe. There already is a victims support group on WhatsApp. After Ruja Ignatova walked off-stage without applaud in Macau, the OneCoin scene has really changed. And Pierre Arens, the new CEO trying to pass off a future Blockchain system as the existing has gotten many OneCoiners to wake up to the truth.”Bjercke tells Cointelegraph that his lawyer had earlier in the week responded to OneCoin’s lawyer, based on the initial letter threatening him to desist from activities against the scheme.However, another conspicuous development in the OneLife community according to Bjercke is the perceived disappearance of the CEO, Pablo Munoz. Munoz was conspicuously missing at the event in Macau where he was scheduled to speak. He has since edited his Linkedin profile, removing every tie to OneCoin/OneLife.",13

Local police commissioner Hemant Nagrale, as well as the local law enforcement, described the OneCoin event as a “Ponzi scheme seminar.”“Hence we arrested the 18 people who had organized the seminar and are investigating the case to trace the mastermind,” said Nagrale.In an interview with Times of India, Nagrale further noted that around $3 mln was seized from OneCoin operators and their bank accounts in a series of raids.Prior to the crackdown of OneCoin in India, a OneCoin satellite firm was shut down and penalized by the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) for operating without a license. IMS International Marketing Services GmbH was fined with $2 mln for ignoring the warnings of the government and local law enforcement.Friedemann Brenneis, the German journalist who reported the closure of the bank accounts of IMS GmBH, was threatened by the legal team and attorneys of OneCoin. On The Coinspondent, Brenneis revealed that he received a massive amount of Abmahnungen, a written warning which demands targeted individuals to settle for a large legal fee to avoid a lawsuit.He wrote:“In the past days, I have received legal letters from several (!) Onecoin lawyers that are extremely irritated about an article I have published. In this article, I was simply pointing out two publications by BaFin (t.n.: the German banking watchdog) concerning Onecoin. Concretely, the two publications in the section of ""illegitimate business"" are this one and this one. For legally tactical reasons I have taken the original article offline, even though all the non-Onecoin people I have talked to about them couldn't find anything wrong with it. Onecoin advocates, however, are known for being very sensitive about criticism. They react all the more fiercely for it.”According to Brenneis, most of the media outlets and journalists that have reported on the same incident took down their articles due to the consistent threats of the OneCoin team. Although the publications allegedly sued by OneCoin remain certain their articles or coverage are fair and transparent, Brenneis reaffirmed that the vast majority of the publishers took out their articles in fear of potential lawsuits that could result in larger legal fees.Brenneis hasn’t taken down the article yet.

While Cassidy expresses his excitement at seeing Blockchain technology blossom in key areas of Africa such as Lagos, he regrets that in this case, the conference itself appears to be a poorly constructed attempt at misdirection.Cassidy explains:“I have had no such interaction with the conference hosts and if you look at the speaker line-up, Andreas Antonopoulos is also listed and has come out and set the record straight as to his involvement.”However, Cassidy notes that Nigeria is going to be a big player in the growth story for Blockchain in Africa, saying that he would love to go speak in Lagos on what is happening. However, obvious attempts to mislead the public like this set the entire industry back. “Hopefully as we move forward these situations become the exception to the rule,” he notes.Roland Alexander, Operations Manager(Africa & Middle East) at Crypto Consultant, who is listed as one of the speakers, also denies having any affiliation to the organizers of this event.

Bitcoin Ponzi Scheme? Indian Government Seem to Disagree With Claim,Joseph Young,2017-04-14 17:50:00,14647,519,"Kirit Somaiya, an Indian politician of the Bharatiya Janata Party, recently described Bitcoin as a Ponzi scheme and claimed that self-regulation is not permitted. However, the Indian government seemed to disagree with Somaiya’s claims and is looking to regulate Bitcoin.The term “Ponzi scheme” is often used by conventional “economists” and politicians to describe Bitcoin. But, the utilization of the term to explain Bitcoin’s structure demonstrates a high level of incompetence and a significant lack of economic and financial knowledge.By literal definition, a Ponzi scheme is a form of fraud in which an operator pays returns to its initial investors by harvesting capital from later investors.Bitcoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency which operates with the absence of an operator or a moderator. No investors are promised quick returns or are scammed by its operators. It merely is a decentralized peer to peer network designed to operate as digital cash and gold.It was quite evident that Somaiya had little to no understanding of the structure of neither Ponzi schemes nor Bitcoin. He presented a severely flawed argument by comparing self-regulation to a Ponzi fraud. In his exact words, Somaiya stated:“It is illegal. How can a private person or a few individuals remain behind curtains can develop their own currency? This self-regulation is nonsense. In a Ponzi scheme, all such arguments like multi-level marketing (MLM) and a pyramid structure have been floated.”Essentially, Somaiya intended to state that self-regulation should not be permitted and that people have no right to utilize a digital currency like Bitcoin that is not developed or created by the central bank.However, his comparison of Bitcoin to a Ponzi scheme was flawed in every possible way, as Ponzi schemes are not self-regulated, they are regulated by a closed group of operators.The government of India and its financial regulators are taking a different approach to that of Somaiya. Many of the regulators have an actual understanding of Bitcoin, its implication to the global economy and the supposed role of regulators in enabling the local Bitcoin industry to grow.Earlier this week, Cointelegraph reported that the Inter-Disciplinary Committee within India’s Ministry of Finance is planning to provide regulatory frameworks for Bitcoin users and businesses in the region, moving a step forward to Bitcoin legalization in India.Various Bitcoin exchanges and businesses including Coinsecure praised the efforts of financial regulators in coming to the realization of Bitcoin’s impact on the economy and the finance industry.Mohit Kalra, Coinsecure CEO, stated:“Finally, something positive for the industry. Authorities are now taking this technology seriously. We have been trying to get their attention for years now. I am glad it's all happening at the right time. At Coinsecure, we are seeing a massive increase in the number of users and volumes. We are positive with what will happen in these coming three months.”",12

The finance minister is expected to officially reply shortly.Speaking in the Parliament, Kirit Somaiya said:“The use of Bitcoin, a hypothetical currency, is increasing at a rapid speed in India as well as in the world. Experts have expressed concern that Bitcoin is a pyramid Ponzi-type scheme. This issue should be taken very seriously and there is urgent need to have a study on the development of Bitcoin in India.

He is a member of the ruling BJP and his words are likely to have an impact in shaping policy.However, as history has shown us, not many experts in the field of finance have been successful in understanding Bitcoin.For example, Dr. Mark Williams, a finance teacher at Boston University, predicted in 2013 that Bitcoin would trade for less than $10 by June 2014.The RBI has taken a nuanced stance on Bitcoin in India.While it has not banned the use of Bitcoin outright, it has issued several warnings on the risks associated with using Bitcoin.Since the usage of Bitcoin is restricted to a small portion of the Indian population, the RBI is watching how the technology evolves.However, the concerns raised by the MP in Parliament could force the RBI into coming out with concrete views on Bitcoin.",3
Bitcoin Price Movements Cause Scams Ebb And Flow: Report,William Suberg,2017-03-24 14:25:00,2985,263,"Bitcoin scam instances closely track Bitcoin price movements, a study into the “dark side” of cryptocurrency by ZeroFOX has found.A report by the Baltimore-based company indicated that a surge in scam operations occurred in the first week of March, just prior to the Winklevoss ETF decision announcement and when Bitcoin price equaled with that of an ounce of gold for the first time.During this time, Bitcoin’s price also spiked. In the days following the rejection of the fund, the price and number of scams dropped accordingly.“To date, we’ve identified 3,618 Bitcoin scam URLs,” the report, which was released Thursday, explains.“We measured how often posts containing these URLs were shared over a three week period in early March and discovered a total of 516 shares averaging 24.53 shares per day.”Social media plays a significant role in the propagation of spurious schemes, ZeroFOX found, echoing behavior of longer-established suspected Ponzi schemes such as OneCoin.“Historically, all curated Bitcoin scam URLs were shared a staggering 126,276,549 times within social media posts. This number was skewed upward by two specific URLs that’ve been shared over 40m times and two others that were shared over 10m times,” the company continues.Last week, Cointelegraph reported on complaints from India’s cryptocurrency business sector regarding a preponderance of scams recently flaring up in the country. In Canada, meanwhile, police advised residents of Ontario to be vigilant in the wake of a fraud scheme targeting customers involving local Bitcoin ATMs.",[]
"Ultimate White Hat Hacker Large Bitcoin Collider Passes 1,000 Trillion Addresses",William Suberg,2017-03-23 10:50:00,2896,279,"The so-called Large Bitcoin Collider (LBC), a tool set up to find and gain access to Bitcoin address funds through private key discovery, recently passed over 1,000 trillion key searches.LBC, which developers describe as “a distributed effort to find at least one collision of private Bitcoin keys,” is creating around 2,000 tn such addresses, matching them against a known list of addresses containing funds.“In the rare event of a collision, the funds on the address in question would become accessible to the collision finder,” its website states.Far from being a malicious effort, the Collider is being used to demonstrate the true strength of Bitcoin’s security.“[The] current consensus is ""that's impossible"" and that is a gauntlet thrown down,” developers continue.“This project is the practice part of the theory behind Bitcoin encryption and protection of funds.”As a distributed effort, the LBC is open to any user wishing to contribute. Pools are even organized to increase the chances of “success,” while the legal implications of keeping discovered funds vary by user location.On that subject, however, the developers take a more hands-off approach.“Depending on your jurisdiction, this may be considered theft and is therefore illegal,” the website continues.“However, there are many [jurisdictions] where you could perfectly legally claim 5-10% of the value found. So you should consider if you want 100% and become a criminal or if you get 10% and still be a law abiding citizen.”The project has so far unearthed a small amount of Bitcoin.Cointelegraph this week provided readers with practical advice on how to secure their Bitcoins, specifically in the wake of the WikiLeaks Vault 7 revelations.",8
"Scam or Not? When in Doubt, Use This 99Bitcoins’ Scam Test",Alicia Naumoff,2017-03-23 10:10:00,6761,315,"While the cryptocurrency market is maturing at an incredible speed, this creates opportunities for people to be scammed. Yes, fraudsters have evolved amazingly in the techniques they are deploying to sneak into our pockets.Sadly, cryptocurrencies fall into that arsenal, which doesn’t help to build trust and facilitate its wider adoption.With endless amounts of Bitcoin services out there it is sometimes hard to tell what is legitimate and what is a scam. There are a few strategies utilized by scammers to gain access to your money.Researchers from Southern Methodist University have been working on the first academic paper monitoring Bitcoin scams. They classified four Bitcoin-related scams: high-yield investment programs, mining investment scams, scam wallet services and scam exchanges.Ofir Beigel, the owner of 99Bitcoins, explains:“The most popular Bitcoin scams out there today are coin multipliers (or doublers) and cloud mining sites. The coin multipliers claim they will double your Bitcoins within a month or make other sorts of ridiculous claims that promise an unrealistic return on investment. These sites are also known as HYIPs (High Yield Investment Programs) - that's just a pretty name for a scam.”As for the cloud mining sites claiming to use user’s funds to invest in mining machines, Ofir believes that, in a sense, 99.9 percent of them work in the same way as the coin doublers.“These sites just take people’s money and then use the money from the new users to pay out the old users,” he says. “Of course this is not a sustainable business model in the long run. In the end, the company just disappears one day with a lot of user funds. It's a classic Ponzi scheme, only now it can hide underneath the confusing and attractive front of Bitcoin.”Bitcoin wallets are increasingly used for stealing money. Scammers advertise their wallets as the safest and most secure way to transfer Bitcoin anonymously, operate them for weeks or months and then eventually hide behind some technical issues.Some scam techniques go much further - there are now Bitcoin scams that involve fake websites, which look exactly like trusted platforms, but mislead users into sending funds to their wallets.Other scams operate as apps and plugins. For instance, not that long ago, the Bitcoin community was warned against a fake LocalBitcoin app, and the Chrome add-on “BitcoinWisdom Ads Remover,” which was stealing Bitcoins by replacing QR codes in popular exchanges with fake ones.Recently, Cointelegraph turned a few heads surrounding BitMagnet and BitKingdom suggesting that these two might be scams. Reportedly, the latter has collected $392 mln worth of Bitcoin and stopped paying out.To shed a little light on the issue, we collaborated with Ofir Beigel from 99Bitcoins and ran an investigation.Please note that we, by no means, try to come to immediate conclusions but rather make an attempt to dive deeper into the issue and provide food for thought.Hopefully, next time you encounter a Bitcoin-related business of a similar kind, you will be able to analyze it and decide for yourself whether it is secure to get involved.99Bitcoins is a website and blog concerning Bitcoins. It aims to educate about cryptocurrency and close the gap between newbies to the industry and the technological aspects of how Bitcoin works through simple tutorials translated from technical to basic human language. It was named the “Blockchain Company of the Year 2016.”The platform has a variety of popular sections including Bitcoin Obituaries which documents every public obituary made about Bitcoin since its beginning. Bitcoin Whiteboard Tuesday provides a video series about basic Bitcoin concepts and the Bitcoin scam test, which we deployed for a little investigation.Ofir said to Cointelegraph:“The tool started out as a way to save myself time in answering my readers' emails. I've been getting so many emails asking me whether site ""x"" or ""y"" were a scam that eventually I decided to teach people how to fish instead of giving them a fish. Ever since this tool was created I replied with ""I actually don't know if this site is a scam or not, but feel free to use my Bitcoin scam test tool and find out for yourself.""The Bitcoin scam test is designed as a quiz consisting of 13 questions, some of them are supported by a variety of external tools (e.g. domain age checker, domain authority checker, etc.).Ofir is coming from an Internet marketing background so he knows how to check a site's online reputation. He is also well aware of the various marketing schemes such sites may employ in order to attract new users.He explains:“For example, these sites often use referral programs to get their customers to bring in more customers. So users who are only focused on making a quick buck start inviting other users without even questioning the company they are promoting. However, that's not to say that every site that has a referral program is a scam, some of the more reputable Bitcoin companies around today have referral programs (e.g. TREZOR, Coinbase, Ledger and more).”BitMagnet.biz Limited is a cryptocurrency investment company registered in the UK. The platform invests money in BTC mining and offers three different investment plans promising 3.60 percent, 4.08 percent and 4.56 percent daily returns.Sounds good, yet questionable. Especially considering their claim of having over 269,000 accounts. Domain age checker shows that the platform has been online since January 2017.So young, yet they have such an enormous amount of users. I guess they have real wizards in their marketing department. Alexa Traffic ranks BitMagnet 30,807 on the global scale with approximately 1.01 daily pageviews per visitor.BitKingdom is a platform for distributing help between community members aimed at fighting poverty. It works similarly to other wealth distribution platforms but (tadam!) integrates Bitcoin.We actually wrote quite recently that the notorious MMM has backed their system with Bitcoin-inspired cryptocurrency. The platform is one year and seven months old, and Alexa gives the website a global rank of 116,640 with 4.20 daily pageviews per visitor.The Page Authority tool lists links pointing to the website. Interestingly, some of them are coming from the media sources discussing Ponzi schemes.But let’s forget about numbers, ranks and metrics for a second. The jungle telegraph is normally what comes to the rescue!Don’t be lazy and take your time to check reviews on Google, Bitcointalk and Reddit before engaging in various kinds of investment plans, even if they promise a fortune.It seems that this is actually nothing new under the sun - known scam techniques are now wrapped in a cryptocurrency package. The prevalence of fraud in the cryptocurrency community is remarkably high.Just look at the percentage of the currency’s monetary base being stolen or lost, the percentage of Bitcoin transactions related to fraudulent activities or the volume of turmoil these schemes create.Bitcoin expert Andreas Antonopoulos once noted that: “humans have used physical security controls for thousands of years. By comparison, our experience with digital security is less than 50 years old.”It is true that we still lack the technical ability to keep our digital funds safe, entrusting our holdings to third parties for safekeeping.The concept of decentralization runs the show in the cryptocurrency community. However, when it comes to ensuring cleanliness and honesty in the space, the idea of establishing a central entity or a standard might not sound like a bad one.After all, without established best practices, industry regulation, licensing or an effective reputation system, we are on our own trying to identify whether that one particular custodian service is trustworthy.Ofir comments:“Personally, I don't think there needs to be a standard - rules will never block people from scamming other people (especially with a semi-anonymous decentralized currency). I do think however that as Bitcoin evolves into a more mainstream technology more people will understand the risks in it and know how to avoid getting scammed.”Ofir recalls the case of the Nigerian price when the Internet was first introduced to the public.He concludes:“This is a phase of Bitcoin evolution we're going through and the only way to change it, in the long run, is by educating people as much as we can about Bitcoin - its advantages and more importantly its risks.”",5
Bitcoin Ponzi Warnings Appear in Canada after India Complaints,William Suberg,2017-03-16 17:45:00,1613,189,"Canada has joined India in issuing warnings about Bitcoin-related Ponzi schemes targeting vulnerable consumers.A report by police in Ontario released Friday states that “fraudsters send cheques to the victims and ask them to use the money to purchase Bitcoins” using local Bitcoin ATMs.The report explains:“The victims deposit the cheque (or sometimes e-transfer) into their accounts then use the funds to buy online currency and deposit the Bitcoins into someone else's account. For doing this, they are told they can keep a certain amount of the money that was originally sent to them. However, a short time after the victim uses their own money to purchase the Bitcoins, the original cheque or e-transfer bounces.”Ontario’s urban areas have a higher than average number of Bitcoin ATMs, especially in the capital Toronto.Nevertheless, the repeat reports highlight a lack of education about the emerging technology common around the world.Last week, Cointelegraph reported on India’s cryptocurrency startups advising that fraudsters were also targeting consumers en masse, using Bitcoin as a means of illicit financial benefit.“The issue of multi-level marketing schemes is a global problem; however, these are now gaining traction in India owing to a lack of governing guidelines and the rapid rise in the value of [...] crypto-currency,” a report quotes local industry body Blockchain Foundation of India.",[]
Bitcoin Fraud Becomes More Frequent in India: Law Enforcement Agencies,William Suberg,2017-03-07 15:17:00,2480,216,"Indian law enforcement agencies have said cyber crime involving Bitcoin is becoming “more frequent.”In an article published by local news resource Mail Today, a spokesman identified as a “senior crime branch officer” said that the rise was linked to a larger number of legitimate businesses accepting the digital currency.“Cases of fraud related to Bitcoins are becoming more frequent,"" he said.“This is partly because many global companies have started accepting digital currency. This has attracted many new investors. However, cashing on its rising popularity, some scamsters are also running fraud set-ups.”Mail Today backed up the claims with news that a Delhi businessman last week lost 850,000 rupees ($12,750) to online scammers purporting to be running a Bitcoin mining operation.According to the publication, the fraudster “promised him 10 Bitcoins with an assurance that the investment will rise twofold within next six months.”The victim did not report the event to the police due to the unofficial status of digital currency as regarded in Indian law.A glance at statistics from the Bitcoin ecosystem meanwhile suggests the legitimate use of Bitcoin continues booming in an economy still feeling the effects of at times poorly handled currency reforms.",2
Cryptocurrency Exchange Yobit Investigated in Russia on Fraud Claims,William Suberg,2017-03-06 14:49:00,11106,259,"Russian telecommunications regulator Roskomnadzor has opened legislative proceedings against cryptocurrency exchange Yobit, alleging fraudulent activity.Forbes Ukraine reports that the watchdog is to block access to Yobit from Russian IP addresses following multiple reports of suspicious activity on the part of administrators.“We are now investigating Yobit as an unreliable resource, with an eye to blocking it as a consequence,” a spokesperson said.Inconsistencies with exchange rates, which allegedly allowed Yobit to profit from its operations illegally, have been the source of a huge numbers of user complaints.Yobit reacted to the news stated it is bogus and is courtesy of EdinarCoin.All news about Yobit are fake and paid by EdinarCoin, don't pay attentionIn June 2016, the team behind Blockchain platform Waves issued a warning to users about similar unusual activity relating to its own token on Yobit’s platform.Specifically, the WAVES token appeared as a BTC pair on Yobit at a stage when it was unable to be withdrawn from private Waves wallets.“We have no evidence to suggest the exchange’s administration took part in the Waves crowdsale or possesses even the smallest number of coins,” a statement read at the time.In an interview with Cointelegraph, Waves management confirmed they had been unable to contact Yobit.Forbes meanwhile notes that Yobit is no longer listed as an exchange partner on high-profile sites such as CoinMarketCap.Founded in Russia in 2015, Yobit is already in the headlines following problems with users trying to withdraw funds from wallets.",7
OneCoin Sinks To New Low Taking From Chinese Man All His Jail Compensation,William Suberg,2017-03-01 13:55:00,1934,161,"A Chinese man who spent 23 years in jail for a murder he never committed has lost one million yuan ($145,000) of his compensation money to OneCoin that many believe is a Ponzi scheme.In a poignant example of how a lack of education makes lay consumers easy prey for OneCoin, Chen Man only realized he had been involved in a pyramid scheme after his lawyer became suspicious.“Most people are not familiar with this area, so, in this new field, I could perhaps stand on the same starting line as everyone else,” Sixth Tone quotes Man as saying. “I’ve been disconnected from society for too long.”OneCoin promised up to 9x returns on Man’s investment when he decided to invest in December 2016, yet after ignoring warnings from a documentary filmmaker following him, he admitted defeat at the weekend when he realized he could not withdraw his investment.Reactions to the story in the Chinese media produced bizarre conclusions, with one newspaper stating that Bitcoin “is actually not very different from OneCoin.”“Ironically, had Man invested the money in Bitcoin instead on Dec. 8, 2016, he would have made around 35 percent profit - or $50,000.” The Chinese perspective is not alone. Uganda and Nigeria have both recently issued warnings against OneCoin while telling the public there was seemingly no difference between the Ponzi scheme and genuine cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.",19
US Corporations are Buying Bitcoin to Quickly Resolve Ransomware Attacks,Joseph Young,2017-02-28 16:51:00,1767,592,"To prevent servers and computers from being encrypted with Bitcoin-demanding ransomware, major US corporations are purchasing Bitcoin to make sure they quickly react to malware encryption.Since early 2016, a time lock system for Bitcoin ransomware has become quite popular. Designers and developers of ransomware purposely include a time frame, usually one week, to pressure victims into paying Bitcoin ransom.Despite the emergence of readily accessible cloud-based platforms, many companies, particularly large-scale corporations, still operate local servers, databases and computers to store important data. Corporate data, including the personal information of users, financial data of clients and confidential company documents, are stored in these local servers which are vulnerable to ransomware or malware attacks when connected to the Internet.Ransomware can be deployed or installed onto servers or devices through a wide range of methods. The most popular method of ransomware deployment is the mass distribution of malicious URLs and files, which automatically installs ransomware to a particular device if the user downloads or opens the URL. Then, the ransomware runs in the background of the server and device, encrypting every piece of information in the device.Pogue, Chief Information Security Officer of Nuix, an information management technology company, says companies are opening Bitcoin wallets and purchasing Bitcoin in case company servers or computers are compromised with ransomware encryption. Companies with larger sets of important financial or personal data are considering Bitcoin as a crucial and necessary response method.According to Pogue, thousands of US companies have already set up Bitcoin wallets and purchased the digital currency to pay ransom to Bitcoin-demanding ransomware distributors. Since their servers and devices contain sensitive material which is valuable to their clients, Pogue explained that companies are taking this strategy very seriously.Pogue writes:“A lot of companies are doing that as part of their incident response planning. They are setting up Bitcoin wallets.”However, Paula Long, CEO of DataGravity, noted that the strategy of acquiring Bitcoin to prevent ransomware attacks can be a moral dilemma for many companies, as they are purposely purchasing the digital currency to support cyber criminals.While the FBI and other law enforcement agencies encourage companies not to settle Bitcoin ransom as it is guaranteed that the criminals or ransomware distributors will send decryption keys to their victims, Long believes it is the responsibility of the company to secure corporate data for their clients and partners.“It’s a moral dilemma. If you pay, you are helping the bad guys. You can’t go to the moral high ground and put your company at risk,” said Long.Since the rapid development of ransomware, companies and analysts have started to claim that the intent of ransomware distributors are always negative. But, in some rare cases, there have been ransomware developers who spread Bitcoin-demanding ransomware in order to help people in need.There were also cases in late December of ransomware distributors providing free decryption keys to victims who are running businesses to help others in need. For instance, an individual going by the online alias “SwervinErvin” received a free decryption key from a ransomware developer after sharing his company’s mission of helping poor children.",1
"Italian Senator Claims Mafia Uses Bitcoin for Gambling, Money Laundering",Amelia Tomasicchio,2017-02-27 11:57:00,2833,360,"Italy is known for pizza, spaghetti and, unfortunately, for its mafia. The mafia is a criminal world that controls the Italian drugs trade, prostitution, gambling and other illegal activities.Of course, all the money received from those illegal activities has to be laundered and it seems that the mafia has started to use Bitcoin for this task. At least this is what was suggested by the Italian Senator from the Democratic Party (Pd), Lucrezia Ricchiuti.As was originally reported by the magazine PressGiochi, the Italian mafia might start using Bitcoin to facilitate the development of its gambling activities.She stated: ""According to research conducted by the Ufficio delle Informazioni Finanziarie (FIU) it is possible to open a gaming site based on Bitcoin in a short time, operating in the absence of controls and in complete anonymity.”Ricchiuti added:“This means we need more and more effort to refine strategies to avoid the situation when the virtual currencies could hide Italian mafia members and help their money laundering.”According to the data provided by The Bitcoin Strip, the total bets amounted to $9.71 bln for the last six months prior to Feb. 24, 2017, with the average bet size of 0.00014842 BTC.50 percent of the total Bitcoin transactions are linked to gambling activities, some experts say.Recently, the UK Gambling Commission (UKGC) commented that any digital currency is an equivalent to fiat money and, therefore, allowed any regulated casino to accept Bitcoin and other digital currencies.On Oct. 31, 2016, the UKGC published its updated License Conditions and Codes of Practice (LCCP) that explained:“Licensees are told that they must “implement appropriate policies and procedures concerning the usage of cash and cash equivalents (eg bankers drafts, cheques and debit cards and digital currencies) by customers”.”According to Ricchiuti’s statement, governments hold no factual evidence to link the Italian mafia to the actual use of Bitcoin in its illegal activities, but it is a possibility to evaluate and, therefore, they want to eliminate the problem at its root, probably introducing stronger Bitcoin regulation.But could this be an effective answer to the problem?Regulating or being afraid of something because it could be used by criminals is like blaming fiat currencies because they are used to buy drugs or weapons. Paradoxically, in this sense, the barter system itself could be feared.Сash money and Bitcoin have a few characteristics in common, especially if you consider their anonymity. In certain countries, the government is trying to put limits on the usage of cash, but this policy raises many questions.Mafia existed before BitcoinItalian Developer Mattia Pintus comments:“The problem of Mafia in Italy, as in the rest of the world, existed well before Bitcoin.Therefore, it would be incorrect to blame everything on Bitcoin, according to journalistic and political conveniences, ignoring the problem itself.”Pintus adds:“In Italy, it’s mostly unhealthy information in this respect, particularly from newspapers that have conflicts of interests, both of the political and economic kind. It would be better and absolutely more constructive, rather, to focus on the positive social as well as economic aspects that the adoption and regulation of Bitcoin could bring to the everyday use by people.”",6
"Africans Learn To Separate Onecoin, Scamcoins From Bitcoin",Olusegun Ogundeji,2017-02-27 09:26:00,2992,1210,"African authorities need to differentiate between Onecoin and Bitcoin, as well as other cryptocurrencies, rather than always place them together when sending out notes of caution, some Bitcoin enthusiasts in Africa have said.Their comments come in the wake of a recent Bank of Uganda media campaign warning against investing in Onecoin. Similar to the one issued recently by the Central Bank of Nigeria, Uganda’s top bank says the Onecoin entity is not licensed under the Financial Institutions Act 2004 hence operating outside any regulatory purview.It also adds that whoever is investing in cryptocurrency forms like Onecoin, Bitcoin, Ripple, Peercoin, Namecoin, Dogecoin, Litecoin, Bytecoin, Primecoin, Blackcoin and others is taking a risk in a financial space where there is neither investor protection nor regulatory purview.The insiders stated that Bitcoin stands out differently for its problem-solving use cases and should be portrayed as such rather than being put side by side with others while their purposes are not well-known.“With just a little bit of research, the Bank of Uganda and all other various government officials slamming Bitcoin will prove that Onecoin does not produce anything of value: it is only a platform that transfers wealth from people at the bottom of the pyramid to people at the top of the pyramid,” says Kagwiria Mworia, a Bitcoin entrepreneur and cryptocurrency educator in Nairobi:“There is not a single cryptocurrency exchange I am aware of that is trading Onecoin. This is a big red flag.”She adds that Bitcoin, on the other hand, is listed as a currency and it serves as a payment system whereby its transactions are all listed in encryption on a public ledger payment system - Blockchain - which is decentralized for anyone to see anywhere.“Decentralization is a big deal as it enables people to create new Bitcoin services and exchanges,” Mworia says:“Centralization, as it is the case with Onecoin, means if no more people join the pyramid, if their website is shut down or the key operators of Onecoin are arrested and jailed for running a Ponzi scheme, then those who invested lose every last dime they ever put into Onecoin. With Bitcoin, there is no Bitcoin company, there is no Bitcoin building, there is even no Bitcoin server that can be shut down. It's completely decentralized.”Though several African countries have seen digital currency-related initiatives springing up, Uganda has been touted to likely be the first African country to regulate digital currencies. A report released in November shows the United Nations African Institute for the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders held its first roundtable discussion in the country where issues related to regulation of digital currencies were discussed.There are now plans to develop instructive guidance underpinned by principles that would be informed by academic research, scholarship and data from the financial regulators.The founder of BitcoinNow in Lagos, Davidson Atere-Roberts thinks African governments need to research more to draw informed conclusions about Onecoin and Bitcoin like some European countries have done in the past.He says:“The Italian government has banned anything Onecoin-related and labeled it an outright scam. Onecoin is a classic pyramid scheme in reality. It is not decentralized neither powered by Blockchain technology, which are the key characteristics of Bitcoin.”He adds that Bitcoin has a market share of over 90 percent to lead about 700 different digital currencies and its market capitalization is currently over $16 bln.Atere-Roberts also cites digital currencies’ roles in Asia where Bitcoin is disrupting the remittance market in countries like Japan, South Korea and the Philippines and are at advanced stages of legalizing Bitcoin. China is also working with the local Bitcoin community by creating a regulatory framework. To him, these actions are in contrast to Onecoin and they clearly distinguish it from the Blockchain-pioneering Bitcoin technology.A request for a comment made to OneCoin’s media unit was not immediately replied as at the time of this publication.",10
"How Scamcoins Similar to OneCoin May Infiltrate CoinMarketCap, Crypto Events",Iyke Aru,2017-02-25 10:05:00,1525,231,"As is common with every developing innovation, bad players always show up to take advantage of the unsuspecting ignorant newbies. What appears to be more worrisome is the inability of certain governments and other presumably reliable platforms to distinguish between the good and bad eggs within the system.With the Bitcoin price reaching an all-time high and showing strong character in terms of value, the entire crypto space has become more attractive and the influx of newcomers has become very significant.Cointelegraph wrote how certain governments have bundled suspicious creations and authentic cryptocurrencies together, with the Bank of Uganda putting OneCoin and Bitcoin in the same trash bucket as an example of such.Founder and CEO at Cashaa, Kumar Gaurav, thinks that such a situation is possible because governments do not turn to the experts who can advise them appropriately. If they did, Gaurav is certain that they would realize that OneCoin has nothing to do with Bitcoin. He describes OneCoin as an organized scam.Gaurav says:“OneCoin has nothing to do with Bitcoin, it is probably the most well-known scam in the sphere, and it has been for a couple of years. Their representatives keep trying to introduce people to their scheme, sometimes without knowing what they are doing, and without knowing what Bitcoin actually is.”Gaurav also retains the opinion that these governments may have to look for experts abroad for research and suggestions on policy making when it comes to the disruptive technology.According to Gaurav, not only governments, but some platforms considered reliable happen to recognize non-qualified entities as cryptocurrencies.At the time of writing, Swiscoin was listed on CoinMarketCap as a genuine cryptocurrency although Gaurav insists that it is a scam like OneCoin.According to Gaurav, conference organizers are giving some suspicious cloud mining companies a platform as sponsor or “expert” speakers, although they have nothing to do with innovation, research or other useful knowledge.The danger of being scammed comes from scamcoins as well as from companies which pretend to be involved in a legitimate cryptocurrency, but are offering services that rip people off, says Gaurav. This fact contributes to institutions getting a wrong opinion about legitimate cryptocurrencies:“When not even some actors in the sphere can make the distinction yet, then it is no surprise that some less-informed governments do not make this distinction either and are either treating legitimate coins as illegitimate or the other way round.”Gaurav suggests that in order to avoid mixing up genuine entities with elements of scam, institutions first have to educate themselves and look at previous institutions’ statements.He notes that there have been plenty of well-researched statements and reports on cryptocurrency by well-known institutions, which have been around as early as the ECB’s on “virtual currency schemes” in 2012.Aleksandar Matanovic does not agree totally that Swiscoin can be considered a scam. He identifies certain features of Swiscoin that may qualify it as a true cryptocurrency. These features include the possibility to buy mining equipment for Swiscoin, so there might be some real mining going on (unlike those who perform “centralized mining”), their claim to be open source and the fact that they are listed on some external exchanges, although with very low trading volumes.Matanovic notes that these three qualities differentiate Swiscoin from those that are obvious scams.Aleksandar Matanovic makes it clear that just because some businesses use MLM for growing its user base doesn’t automatically make it a scam. However, he expresses his dislike for most of the MLM “cryptocurrencies” not being honest about what they really are.Matanovic says:“They are mostly claiming that they are the “new Bitcoin” while in fact, they have no similarities with Bitcoin except for having “coin” as a part of their name.”He explains that as long as propagators are honest about what they are and are not misleading people and the value of their coin is decided by the laws of the market and not by internal price manipulation, then there is nothing wrong if there is an MLM element to it or if the product is not even a cryptocurrency at all. “Just don’t claim to be a cryptocurrency if you are not one.”Matanovic says:“As far as I can see, they might be a real cryptocurrency. We have to differentiate the technology part from the marketing part. As far as the technology part is concerned, they might be the real deal, with features that cryptocurrencies have. However, it doesn’t guarantee that the MLM part of their business isn’t a scam. The question becomes: Are they running a cryptocurrency project and using sound and legit MLM system to help grow the user base or are they running an MLM scam and using the technology they have developed as an excuse?”",7
Bitcoin Community Alert: How Scammers Monetize Traders’ Fears and Greed,Iyke Aru,2017-02-17 11:23:00,990,382,"With every innovative technology come those who seek to take advantage of its users. Unfortunately, the Bitcoin ecosystem is not exempted from this. Many Ponzi schemes have been built around Bitcoin and unsuspecting investors have lost their wealth in different circumstances.A developing ill within the crypto environment is the selling of substandard education to an unsuspecting public. This has come in the form of seminars, tutorial sessions and incoherent study materials. The promoters of these programs ride on the emotions of previous investors who have lost money, with claims of teaching them what they should have known before investing. For the newbies, it is their fear of being hurt that is usually exploited.Nawaf Abdullah of eBitcoinics.com thinks that the major motivation behind this developing trend is the quest for relevance within the ecosystem, as the battle for control and authority within the Bitcoin environment continues.Abdullah tells Cointelegraph that even among crypto enthusiasts there are different categories of people who pursue their individual goals using the disruptive technology. There are those who are primarily concerned about the future of the technology and its numerous use cases, then the network marketers whose priority is to sell a given product or service. There is also the group that will do just about anything to flinch whatever they can from the unsuspecting public.It is the final group who are the ones most likely to engage in HYIPS and various get-rich-quick programs.However, Abdullah notes that these activities, in whatever form they appear, have a direct effect on the entire ecosystem, and therefore calls on every genuine industry leader to play a significant part in creating a proper brand for the technology.Abdullah says:“It is up to every leader involved within the crypto world to know that any step taken tends to affect all of us, whether positive or negative. We have seen governments and institutions trying to control this technology, but thanks to decentralization, such has not been possible. Therefore, we have the responsibility to uphold the genuineness of what we have.”Abdullah explains that at eBitcoinics.com their priority remains passing on the proper education to everyone within the community, getting them well equipped for the world out there where all sorts of information will definitely be thrown at them.Another danger posed by this trend of having the wrong education propagated is the fact that if not curbed at its early stage, there may come a time when the truth may sound like a lie and vice versa. Therefore, the people need to be taught how to identify what is real and what is not in this fast-moving era of innovations.“Today we have lots of educational forums, groups on social networks and different bodies creating serious awareness and all these could be places the lots can make use of,” says Abdullah. “In Africa, we have seen what CDIN is doing wholeheartedly to make the world of cryptocurrencies a better place and that’s what encourages us at eBitcoinics.com to fully pledge our support to such good movements, to help make cryptocurrencies a better topic to be discussed in Africa.”Abdullah continues by advising every newbie in the industry to take advantage of the endless availability of information on the Internet. According to him, personal research is the responsibility of anyone who hopes to make the most of the disruptive technology.“It is by inquisitive research that anyone can discover genuinely available resources for proper education,” says Abdullah. He concludes by telling Cointelegrah that at eBitcoinics.com their mission is to reach every household in Ghana, Nigeria and Africa as a whole with the proper information about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency.To achieve this, platforms such as WhatsApp, Telegram, Facebook and their own website have been employed in addition to regular meetups at physical locations.Also, mechanisms are in place to launch their strictly educational portal, where anyone who wants to learn about money and its role in the world economy and why cryptocurrency is the immediate future can find every necessary resource.",1
Dark Web: Stolen Credit Card Details Going For £11 A Piece,William Suberg,2017-02-15 19:27:00,28832,74,"New data shows that on average, stolen Visa or MasterCard details cost just £11 ($15) to buy on the dark web with Bitcoin or other anonymous altcoins.Figures compiled by UK credit reporting agency Equifax shows the US to be the cheapest area in which to purchase stolen card information, with the EU and the UK prices around 2.5 times higher.“There is a huge variety of stolen data available for sale on the dark web, including both financial information and login details,” Equifax comments.Interestingly, items such as hacked email accounts go for much more, particularly if they are popular. Current rates are around £90 per account, along with social media login credentials. Corporate email accounts go for much more - around £350.The surprisingly low price of payment cards is indicative of the ease with which such items can be sourced. It is not just physical theft; large-scale data breaches are the major culprits for credentials of millions of customers being wholesale transferred into malicious hands.“It is evident from the infographic that a buyer won’t have to loosen pockets much [to lose] such sensitive information,” Fossbytes writes commenting on the data.Recently, customers of UK-based Tesco Bank found their accounts emptied of cash after cyber criminals hacked security systems, stealing £2.5 mln from 9000 people (figures changed since the original article was published).",2
Russian Hacking: Four Men Face Treason For Passing On Information From Russia to CIA,Joseph Young,2017-02-12 14:07:00,7737,334,"Sergei Mikhailov, head of cybersecurity at the Federal Security Service (FSB) of Russia, his deputy Dmitry Dokuchaev, Ruslan Stoyanov, head of the cyber crime investigations department at Kaspersky Lab and a Ukraine-based journalist Vladimir Anikeev have all been arrested to face charges of treason.The four men are accused of passing on confidential information from within the FSB to the CIA, the central intelligence agency of the US. Stoyanov, an employee of multi-bln dollar cybersecurity firm Kaspersky, is alleged to have passed on sensitive information about the previous Russian government's investigation into agencies outside of Russia.If proven guilty, the four men will likely face 20 years in prison, the standard sentence for treason in Russia.In early January, Cointelegraph released an article entitled “Hackers Faked Locations in DNC Hack, McAfee Says it Wasn’t Russia,” which explicitly revealed the beliefs of industry leader John McAfee, founder of cybersecurity firm McAfee, on the DNC-Russia hacking attack controversy.At the time, McAfee explained that a third party institution or organization would have likely used certain software to disguise the locations of cyber attacks against the DNC. By linking the attacks to Russia and eliminating any possible traces back to themselves, hackers successfully led the US to believe that Russian hackers broke into the DNC.McAfee stated:“If I was the Chinese and I wanted to make it look like the Russians did it, I would use the Russian language within the code, I would use Russian techniques of breaking into the organization. There simply is no way to assign a source for any attack.”However, the Russian government launched an official investigation into Mikhailov and his deputy after it was revealed that US cybersecurity firm ThreatConnect claimed that hackers used an Internet hosting company known as King Servers to attack the DNC. The government was concerned with the accusations of the operator of King Servers, who claimed that Mikhailov had been working for the FBI.Local analysts and media companies aren’t certain if the details of the trial will be released in the near future. The FSB tends to hold trials in secret and usually refuses to reveal information about their trials.Some experts of the Russian cybersecurity scene including Andrei Soldatov, author of “A History of Russia’s Attempts to Control the Internet,” firmly believe that the arrest of Mikhailov and the other three men are a part of a cover-up being initiated by the Russian government.Soldatov stated that FSB officers couldn’t have been involved with the Shaltai-Boltai hacking group, who have launched attacks against the government over the past few years.",2
Poland’s Bitcoin Exchange Bitcurex Disappears in Mt.Gox Fashion,Shivdeep Dhaliwal,2017-02-08 14:33:00,1725,351,"Bitcurex, one of Poland’s largest exchanges has shut shop after a reported 2300 BTC ($ 1.5 mln) theft. The polish exchange was one of the oldest in the country.Before the website of Bitcurex was taken down, a message was posted by the administrators in Polish which translated reads:“On 13.10.2016 as a result of third-party systems service www.bitcurex.com/ www.bitcurex.com damaged by external interference in automated data collection and processing of information. The consequence of these actions is the loss of part of the assets managed by bitcurex.com/dashcurex.com.” Bitcurex had promised to return money back to the users within seven days according to the Polish newspaper Gazeta. It is further alleged by Bitcoin.pl that the exchange had no records left after it was attacked and it was asking users to submit forms to confirm ownership of assets.“Given that the exchange required proved ownership of the site and that the confirmed balance disagreed with the facts,” Bitcoin.pl wrote in an article, “you can come to the conclusion that the exchange does not have a current copy of the database, which could be damaged at the time of the alleged hacking.”Not only has the exchange shut down and people have most likely lost all their money, it also came to light that customer data of the exchange was also compromised in the hack that took place in October 2016. The lack of customer data with the exchange is a strong indicator of that.While the last tweet on the company’s twitter handle was made on Sep. 12, 2016, the Facebook page of Bitcurex is still active and is riddled with comments and posts from angry customers.One user Daniel Jarek simply posted “Thieves”, while another Daniel Stachurski wrote, “Scammers.”We have repeated again and again that you should never keep your cryptocurrency in any hot wallet for any time longer than absolutely necessary.Poland itself has a lesson to learn in this since it has long been ambiguous about the status of Bitcoin in the country and has refused to take a proper stance on it.However, hopefully, things are changing in Poland as we recently covered and the authorities will be more prepared to lay the groundwork for the operation of exchanges in the future.As for Bitcurex, their motto was “When you invest in what you believe, you are ahead of the rest.” We urge everyone to be more focused on facts rather than beliefs and do their due diligence.",6
"OneCoin Leads Top 3 Scam Coins List, S-Coin, EarthCoin Follow",Iyke Aru,2017-02-07 16:13:00,29631,2212,"A lot of individuals have fallen victim to cryptocurrency scams by investing in what they thought were real and genuine cryptocurrencies. Despite several campaigns by enthusiasts of already proven cryptocurrencies, altcoin vendors and investors have insisted on the genuineness of their preferred coins.Popularity and followership are definitely not among the properties that qualify a given entity as a real cryptocurrency. As a matter of fact, these characteristics reveal the extent to which these altcoins can be negatively rated at their levels of scam.Lead Consultant at One27 Global Consult, Solomon Barnabas tells Cointelegraph about his ordeal at the hands of vendors of scam coins.Barnabas says that such coin vendors always sold more referral programs to unsuspecting members with claims that the crowdfunding is necessary for adoption. This he said has caused him a lot of losses both in cash and credibility.Barnabas says:“The problem with such programs is that they do not only end up with losing your money, they mess up your relationship with friends and loved ones. The people that you refer to most from these programs are predominantly those who join because they trust and believe in you. Imagine having to struggle to rebuild a reputation that was built over almost a lifetime.”Angelina Lazar, a rogue economist, ideologue and cryptocurrency revolutionary, advises anyone who intends to join a company that acquires or invests in any altcoin, to first seriously research what the cryptocurrency is, then study all the aspects of the coin itself. For example, such self-education has been made available and affordable by institutions such as Nexxus University.For Angelina Lazar, OneCoin takes the day as the current number one scam coin in the world. Lazar, who has become popular for her war on OneCoin, tells Cointelegraph that she is expecting conclusive information on OneCoin’s dealings within the next month.This is after, what she refers to as, a nasty war between her camp and that of OneCoin. According to Lazar, her camp succeeded in getting all of OneCoin’s bank accounts shut down and even China's UnionPay is not interested in dealing with them anymore.One common position adopted by the propagandists of OneCoin in recent times is the claim that OneCoin is not a cryptocurrency yet. This argument always seems to arise as soon as they realize that their product does not possess the fundamental characteristics of a genuine cryptocurrency. How these followers tend to pursue the cause of OneCoin like a religion is a development that is becoming a subject of keen interest.To this effect, Lazar points out that the leaders at OneCoin have not relented in making efforts to convince their followers around the world that they are now going public.She explains to Cointelegraph:“Which exchange on the planet besides Nibiru would take that company public when their whole management team is being investigated and their CEO is both on bail and on probation simultaneously. That's two different cases in two different countries, mind you. And when they have not one bank account in their name and even all their tertiary accounts which they used for money-laundering in various other names were all shut down as well?”Second is S-Coin (Coinspace). Packages for S-Coin range up to 12,000 euros. Lazar tells Cointelegraph that this is yet another pyramid scheme with, as she believes, an unsustainable compensation plan, just like OneCoin.Another characteristic of S-Coin which resembles that of OneCoin is the promise of hope. The Coinspace community run what could be easily referred to as a pyramid scheme with the promise of releasing a cryptocurrency in the future. One major promise of theirs that raises some suspicion is the act of attaching a price of one Euro to the said cryptocurrency. At this point, the question of attaching value to an entity without the basic science of supply and demand comes to the forefront.They ask the public to pay Bitcoins for S-Coins and claim they will mail the coins to their clients, a scenario that Lazar considers ridiculous because cryptocurrencies are supposed to be digital coins. Lazar says that if they were real and legit, they would be part and parcel of a real Blockchain and be only digital, so that they're spoken for, encrypted, ultimately secure, transparent, and safe and visible.The third top scam coin identified by Lazar is EarthCoin. Although a quick search on coinmarketcap.com reveals a market cap of $935,638 and an available supply of 9,346,468,332 EAC, Lazar does not seem convinced that the coin is genuine.This coin also has its superblocks, whose coins were vastly pre-mined and even instamined, suggesting that some or all of a coin’s initial supply is generated automatically by the developer at, or prior to, the public launch, rather than being generated over time through a form of mining. Such tricks are usually applied in a pump and dump set-up schemes.Nawaf Abdullah, CEO of a Ghana-based Bitcoin exchange eBitcoinics, tells Cointelegraph about his reluctance towards accepting EarthCoin.Abdullah says:“It is just one of those pump and dump coins which probably would have its HYIPs and all, right after getting the recognition it needs, they just dump it and it's back to the nothing, that’s what it is.”With no good website, neither any robust information to tell what the coin really is or intends to achieve and a current volume, Nawaf says that all visible factors justify the coin as an element that can be dumped at any given moment.“Seriously if you ask me I have no vivid info what to even tell you rather than what it is really and that's a big scam a coin it is. Not every cryptocoin is worth the try and EarthCoin is a stay away from type,” he concludes.We may not see the last of creations that are characterized by unclear processes. However, it is the responsibility of every individual or group of investors to carry out proper due diligence ahead of venturing into new areas of investment.",45
"Western Union Fined $586 Mln for Money Laundering, Fraudulent Transfers",Frisco d'Anconia,2017-01-20 13:22:00,1080,1111,"Remittance giant Western Union has been fined $586 mln after admitting to money laundering and supporting fraudulent wire transfers. The penalty of $586 mln will be used as a refund for the victims of the crimes.The Department says Western Union's negligence led to malpractices, and that they could have prevented the significant loss to US consumers if due diligence was upheld.Edith Ramirez, chair of the Federal Trade Commission, noted that:“Western Union owes a responsibility to American consumers to guard against fraud, but instead the company looked the other way, and its system facilitated scammers and rip-offs.”The move follows investigations by the US Department of Justice that implicated the company for deliberately failing to keep an efficient anti-money laundering mechanism.Scammers who duped Americans used the firm’s services to transfer their loot.Acting Assistant Attorney General David Bitkower said in a statement released on Thursday:""As this case shows, wiring money can be the fastest way to send it – directly into the pockets of criminals and scam artists.""To prevent the future occurrence of such criminal activities, Western Union will enter into an agreement with the Department of Justice and other government agencies including the U.S. Attorney General.The arrangement includes guarantees upon future possible swindles. The guarantees will be regulated by the Federal Trade Commission. The DOJ and the FTC require money transmittal outfits to block money transfers sent to any person who is the subject of a fraud report.They also demand from the Western Union to provide clear and conspicuous consumer fraud warnings on its paper and electronic money transfer forms; to increase the availability of websites and telephone numbers that enable consumers to file fraud complaints; and to refund a fraudulently induced money transfer if the company failed to comply with its anti-fraud procedures in connection with that transaction.All US citizens who suspect they have been duped through fraudulent transactions via Western Union are to report it to the US Department of Justice.Since 2009, governments have been pointing fingers at Bitcoin and other digital currencies as a conduit for money laundering and fraudulent activities. Many crypto experts believe that the accusations were unfounded, looking at the meager market cap of Bitcoin. In fact, it is Bitcoin and Blockchain technology that can prevent such criminal activities.The time is ripe for people to shun traditional remittance services and embrace smart money transfer programs based on the Blockchain.",3
Caution: Scammers Can Steal Your Bitcoins Right at Blockchain Conferences,Joseph Young,2017-01-19 15:55:00,1532,262,"Participants at various Bitcoin and Blockchain conferences have been receiving fraudulent Bitcoin hardware wallets imitating legitimate products like Trezor and Ledger to steal user’s funds.Andrew Desantis, CEO at DeSantis Inc and former 21 Inc technology editor, revealed that participants at the New York Bitcoin conference in 2015 were given free hardware wallets designed specifically to steal user’s funds and Bitcoin.As seen below, the fake hardware wallets did not have proper branding yet many participants who have not come across hardware wallets were convinced they were legitimate failing to recognize that they were essentially a trojan horse-based product.Several hardware wallets exist such as Trezor, Ledger and KeepKey that are often recommended for users storing large amounts of Bitcoin. Instead of storing Bitcoin in custodial platforms or exchanges, it is much safer to store Bitcoin in a non-custodial ecosystem wherein users have full control over their funds and private keys.Extensive media coverage on the practicality and advantage of using hardware wallets over online Bitcoin exchanges or wallets to store Bitcoin pushed the demand for safe and popular products like Trezor.However, when individuals see a Trezor-like hardware wallet in a Bitcoin conference without having seen an actual Trezor wallet before, they may take the free giveaway and use it to store Bitcoin. Thus, it is important for users to evaluate free products given at conferences or even products that are sold at various events to ensure that the hardware wallet or any Bitcoin-related product are legitimate.DeSantis also has come across fraudulent USB miners at a conference in Las Vegas, which were freely distributed to people interested in running Bitcoin computers. 21 Inc, a venture capital-backed Bitcoin company, is well known for its signature 21 Bitcoin Computer which is used by many Bitcoin enthusiasts worldwide. Targeting this market, scammers are giving away Bitcoin computers designed to steal user funds of individuals.One more time: On the left we have a @21 #Bitcoin Computer, very safe. On the right we have a USB miner (malware) I was given in Vegas. pic.twitter.com/us8cjhYHV6Whether it is a hardware wallet or a Bitcoin computer, it is important for users to acquire Bitcoin-related products through a reliable source. The best way is to order them directly from the websites or e-commerce platforms hosted or supported by the manufacturers.",4
Bitcoin Exchange That Hacked JPMorgan Chase: Three More in Court,William Suberg,2017-01-18 15:50:00,691,142,"The fallout from the Israeli exchange Coin.mx’s shut down two years ago continues with three more people due to be sentenced in court next month.Among them is the United States resident Ricardo Hill, accused of engaging in fraudulent activities while working for the exchange which orchestrated cyber attacks against companies such as JPMorgan Chase while it was operating.In July 2015, Cointelegraph reported on the initial indictment of Coin.mx, which prosecutors believe is partly responsible for a cyber attack compromising the details of around 80 mln customers at the global accounting firm.Now, Hill and former operator Anthony Murgio will face charges “that included conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business and conspiracy to commit bank fraud,” Finance Magnates reported Wednesday.Neither is accused of hacking JPMorgan Chase and other companies directly, however, there are charges placed on seven other conspirators, including the exchange’s alleged owners Gery Shalon and Joshua Aaron.Hill had previously been released on a $75,000 bond in November 2016.Murgio, his accomplice Yuri Lebedev and others were suspected of selling Bitcoins to victims of ransomware attacks, helping fund criminal activity, the FBI stated when the case first came to light:“Murgio and his co-conspirators have also knowingly exchanged cash for Bitcoins for victims of “ransomware” attacks. In doing so, Murgio, and his co-conspirators knowingly enabled the criminals responsible for those attacks to receive the proceeds of their crimes, yet, in violation of federal anti-money laundering laws, Murgio never filed any suspicious activity reports regarding any of the transactions.”Coin.mx was in fact shielded during its operations by several front businesses, including one in the United States called Collectibles Club.“Murgio, Lebedev and their co-conspirators engaged in substantial efforts to evade detection of their scheme by operating through a phony front company, “Collectables Club,” and maintaining a corresponding phony “Collectables Club” website,” the FBI report continued,“In doing so, they sought to trick the major financial institutions through which they operated into believing that their unlawful Bitcoin exchange business was simply a members-only association of individuals who discussed, bought, and sold collectable items, such as sports memorabilia.”It is understood that Hill and Murgio have pleaded guilty to all charges along with two other men due to face trial in February.",[]
"Hackers Faked Locations in DNC Hack, McAfee Says it Wasn’t Russia",Joseph Young,2017-01-13 18:15:00,636,2098,"Cyber Security expert and founder of the anti-virus software McAfee, and MGT Capital Investments CEO John McAfee firmly believes Russia wasn’t involved in the Democratic National Committee, hereinafter DNC, hack.According to the Joint Analysis Report released by the FBI, the group of cyber criminals that allegedly hacked the DNC used various locations apart from Russia to breach the DNC’s servers. In fact, the majority of IP addresses listed in the report were traced all over the world outside of Russia.By the variety of IP address traces alone, McAfee states that the group of hackers faked their location and eliminated any branches of data that could have linked back to them. It is more likely that a third party organization or group initiated the attack to create controversy involving the Russian government.McAfee said in an interview with Larry King:“If I was the Chinese and I wanted to make it look like the Russians did it, I would use the Russian language within the code, I would use Russian techniques of breaking into the organization. There simply is no way to assign a source for any attack.”Whether it was the Russians or independent hacking groups from all over the world that hacked the DNC isn’t necessarily important. In actuality, it is more urgent to evaluate the vulnerability of the IT infrastructure and the poor security measures of government-owned platforms.As of late, the United States government and its investigators are allocating their resources solely to unraveling the faces behind the hacking. Less time has been spent on analyzing how the DNC was hacked in the first place and if the government can develop resilience towards similar types of attacks in the future.Cases like the DNC hack are pushing the demand for non-backdoorable and decentralized technologies, wherein information is securely kept, transferred in a decentralized ecosystem and processed efficiently.The reliance and dependence on central servers to store any type of data can easily expose important information to sophisticated hacking attacks or data breaches.As a response to various controversial cases stemming from manipulation of data banks and financial institutions are increasingly testing Blockchain technology to process transactions securely.",25
"Arcade City a.k.a. “Uber Killer” Hard Forks, Founder Claims Fraud",Joël Valenzuela,2017-01-09 18:15:00,5174,682,"Arcade City’s leadership has rebranded into a separate entity, something its founder is not happy with.In an effort to bypass a controversial past, Arcade City, the Ethereum-based ride sharing project that generated great buzz in the Blockchain world before hitting delays late last year, has split. The council and several key community members have rebranded and formed a new entity named Swarm City, which will have the use of the funds raised in the ARC token sale.However, Christopher David, Arcade City’s founder and sole owner of Arcade City, Inc., is not happy with the rebranding and does not believe that the crowdfund should be used to power what he views to be a competing entity.Bernd Lapp, the former mayor of Arcade City and the current head of Swarm City, says that the rebranding was, in part, an effort to distance from David’s influence as well as the baggage he had accrued over the years:“We have a different understanding of decentralized organizations and he had previously made commitments that we could not fulfill. Therefore, it was important for us to separate from him and his organization Arcade City Inc.”Since its inception, Arcade City had a background surrounded with controversy, as some former employees and collaborators alleged shady dealings on David’s part. The rebranding, therefore, was meant to continue the project from a fresh slate.However, complications have already arisen from the rebranding. David, who is still committed to furthering the Arcade City brand, takes issue with the split. In particular, he sees the use of funds raised in the ARC token sale to be problematic, as they were raised to support the development of what he sees to be an entirely different project:“They are using money raised specifically for one project to launch a separate project. I believe that is called ""fraud”.”Lapp, however, sees no issue with the rebranding, noting that David stepped down from the Arcade City council of his own will, under the stated goal to launch a supporting business centered around the decentralized platform:“Christopher stepped down to create value for his own company by contributing to the sharing economy platform that we are building now (see his tweet from Nov. 8). In my opinion, nothing has changed for him on that. Even more so, now he can use the name Arcade City for his own projects that could fit right into Swarm City...just like everyone else has the opportunity to create products around our platform in the future.”Whatever the intentions of the founders of both Arcade City and Swarm City, the project has split in two, with camps of supporters forming around both projects. David believes that few community members were in favor of the rebranding, especially those who had invested resources in building their own businesses around the Arcade City brand:“The only people happy with the split are those being paid from the token sale. Community feedback was overwhelmingly negative about the idea of a rebrand. Certainly, none of our active riders or drivers wanted one, especially not our thousands of happy users in Austin. The idea didn’t come from the community, it was pushed by certain people on the “Arcade City Council” who were new to the project and wanted to start with a clean slate, minus me and the other stakeholders of Arcade City, Inc.”Lapp acknowledges the challenges presented by a change in brand, but maintains that these will be temporary and the move will pay off in the long run:“In the beginning, it was not well received, especially by the people within our own group who have worked hard in the last year to build the Arcade City brand. Once we came up with the name, referencing what they always referred to themselves as being the “Swarm” and giving credit to their past by adding “City,” it was easier. And still we hear voices that dislike the new name, sometimes because a business was already built (Business cards printed, etc), or because they simply dislike the name, like a few in the Ethereum community that refers to the Ethereum Swarm (a tool in the Ethereum Stack) already being around.Overall, these are still early days for the Arcade City brand, creating a new brand with a new more global community is still timed right and will not take that long to create. Especially with the right people on board.”The funds raised in the initial Arcade City token sale remain a key sticking point for disagreement. Lapp explains their use consistent with the original whitepaper:“As the whitepaper states, we offer 476,253 ARC tokens (5 percent of the total tokens raised) to all Arcade City investors who want to tokenize. We invite them to step forward to swarm.city with a proposal that has consensus with the signatories of the proposal showing the division of tokens each should receive within 12 weeks from now. After the 12 weeks, swarm.city will send the tokens to the signatories’ ether addresses. Furthermore, we offer 1/3rd of 1 percent of the tokens to the janitor of Arcade City according to the vesting terms in the white paper.”Regarding Swarm City’s position on the legitimacy of using the funds for a project with a new name, David disagrees:“It fulfills one basic promise from the whitepaper while avoiding the more important fact that those funds were specifically promised to build an Ethereum app for Arcade City, not launch a competing project.If your convenience store gets robbed and the thieves throw you a purse of coins from the window of the getaway car, would that make you feel good about the theft?”Despite additional controversy arising from hard forking a project that has already gathered a considerable community and amount of buzz, Lapp believes that the rebranding was the right move, and the only way forward for a project that he views as more important than merely a brand name:“The new brand is a solution to a technical roadblock that kept the team from continuing development. Having control over the brand is necessary to execute the white paper. When we look at investors we have identified at least three different types of investors. 1. Early investors that hold shares in Arcade City Inc.; 2. Early investors that receive token through the token sale (SAFE Investors that receive 5 percent of tokens as stated in the white paper); and 3. The token backers that participated in the token sale. We are complying with the white paper, which covers the SAFE investors and the token backers. Overall, we are creating the sharing economy platform for which the token was created.I do not believe that the token backers have invested in the brand name, but rather the concept described in the white paper. Shareholders in Arcade City Inc. need to ask their CEO how he will create value in the ecosystem of the sharing economy platform, just as Christopher stated in his tweet. Until we have a product out and people can see and feel it, I can tell investors as much as I want...but it's the product that will be most telling.”",12
Nigerians Declare War on Cryptocurrency Scam,Iyke Aru,2017-01-04 13:57:00,987,354,"Cryptography Development Initiative in Nigeria (CDIN) has created a platform called the “Nigeria Blockchain Alliance” (NBA) which brings together law enforcement agents, legal practitioners, forensic investigators and government agencies among others to collaborate in the fight against cryptocurrency related crimes within the country.The President of CDIN, Adeolu Fadele, tells Cointelegraph that this development is in support of the government’s efforts in fighting electronic fraud in Nigeria and to prevent fraudsters from giving the country a negative reputation in the new generation of digital innovation.Dipo Fatokun, chairman of the Nigeria Electronic Fraud Forum and the director of Banking and Payments System of the Central Bank of Nigeria, acknowledged that fraudsters are usually quicker in catching onto new trends in the technological space within the country. Fatokun notes the need for regulators and operators in the Nigerian financial system to be well informed and not left out in the developmental processes of the Blockchain technology.According to Obiora Awogu, a forensic analyst at UBA Group, today’s cryptocurrency scams in Nigeria seem to have taken over the old fashioned 419 scam.“While it could be said that a lot of people fall for these scams because of greed, it is also evident that they may not have adequate knowledge about cryptocurrencies and its underlying technology. These people are lured into bogus pyramid and HYIP schemes using Bitcoins and other altcoins for payment,” says Awogu.He also notes that fraudsters have capitalized on the ignorance of the participants of these schemes by pretending to sell Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies at unbelievably low rates, thereby swindling their victims after payment has been made.Awogu acknowledges the government’s efforts in fighting electronic fraud within the Nigerian financial ecosystem. However, he says that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency scams are spreading so fast that the government is trying to play catch up.Awogu tells Cointelegraph that Nigeria Blockchain Alliance successfully tackled a number of cryptocurrency scam cases in collaboration with banks and law enforcement agents.“We recently set up a team to receive and confirm these scams and document and organize the evidence in a professional manner. This will also help in keeping an archive of known cryptocurrency fraudsters in the country,” he concludes.CDIN President Adeolu Fadele tells Cointelegraph of his surprise at the number of reported cases of cryptocurrency scams within just one week of launching NBA. He describes the situation as “alarming.”However, Fadele commends the efforts so far being made by the government in the achievement of the New Evidence Act 2011 and the Cybercrime Act 2015.“Without these two legal provisions, the task of fighting cryptocurrency scams would have been more difficult,” says Fadele.Fadele points out that government agencies may not have proper visibility into the activities going on in the unregulated ecosystems, like that of cryptocurrencies, and as a result will be limited in what they can do in such spaces. Thus, Nigeria Blockchain Alliance under CDIN will play a significant role in filling the vacuum hitherto created.Fadele continues by explaining that Nigeria Blockchain Alliance is a voluntary organization comprised mainly of youths from different walks of life.He says:“It is important to understand at this point that the Nigeria Blockchain Alliance is only a voluntary service offered by well-meaning Nigerian youths from the public and private sectors including the law enforcement agencies, cybersecurity professionals, military personnel’s, legal practitioners, forensic investigators, bankers, merchants, private companies and regulatory authorities.”Despite being in its early stages, Fadele believes that Nigeria Blockchain Alliance is a critical step in protecting public safety by combating criminal activity in the cryptocurrency and Blockchain digital innovation space. He also believes that it is an important step for the growth of the Blockchain industry.The short-term goal of NBA, according to Fadele, is to leverage the support of government agencies and stakeholder private organizations. It is hoped that this will reduce the rate at which people that are negatively motivated by the absence of regulatory framework can go in labeling Nigeria with another negative reputation in the new world of cryptocurrency and Blockchain digital innovation.“In the long run, the CDIN hopes to collaborate with relevant government agencies and private institutions to develop a policy framework, create awareness, discourage crime, protect the public and unlock new jobs and business opportunities in the Nigerian cryptocurrency and Blockchain ecosystem,” concludes Fadele.",10
Italy Suspends Onecoin’s Activities Declaring Them a Pyramid Scam,Olusegun Ogundeji,2016-12-31 10:50:00,3822,2024,"The antitrust authority in Italy, Autorità Garante della Concorrenza e del Mercato - or the Italian Competition Authority - has announced that it has adopted an interim injunction against the activities of One Network Services Ltd., the company which has been promoting OneCoin in Italy.This follows an investigation launched to assess the system designed and operated by One Network Services Ltd. and its representatives in Italy to promote a program for OneCoin which they claim involves the purchasing of training packages “which should enable consumers to achieve significant economic returns, for example with an investment of 140 euros promises a return 2800 euros in two years.”It says the investigation is as a result of reports received by the Commissione Nazionale per le Società e la Borsa, also known as CONSOB, the body responsible for regulating the Italian financial markets, and the CTCU of Bolzano- or the Centre Protection of Consumers and Users- also supported by findings of the Special Unit Antitrust Guardia di Finanza.The notice, published this weekend, states that the evidence gathered so far shows that the representation of the advantages of OneCoin attracts the entry of a large number of consumers to make significant economic investments in the scheme which has been traced to a pyramid sales system that is prohibited by law.There have been several warnings against OneCoin being a scam.Several related moves have been made and warnings issued in the past in other parts of Europe.In July, Belgium’s Financial Services and Markets Authority, also known as FSMA, warned the public to be wary of activities related to OneCoin saying the scheme has not received authorization or any form of recognition from the regulatory body. Additionally, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority cited OneCoin as a risk to consumers.German regulators started looking into OneCoin. The German newspaper Der Spiegel reported in June that the financial regulatory body Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) had opened an investigation into this too.However, in the notice issued by Italy in which it charged that “none of the professionals involved in the proceedings provided explanations and adequate defenses to understand the likelihood of the promised results, as well as on the functioning of the system promoted,” all activities to the promotion and dissemination of OneCoin as well as training packages linked to it are suspended as a precautionary measure possibly to limit the damage to consumers pending the conclusion of the investigation.",14
Tasmania’s Bitcoin Porn Scam Belies Global Ransomware Threat,William Suberg,2016-11-23 10:49:00,1030,120,"Rural Tasmania has become the unlikely target of a porn scam, defrauding residents by making them pay for normally free antivirus software using Bitcoin.Police on the island are currently investigating the origins of the operation, which comes in the form of a virus infecting user devices.The news comes against a backdrop of high-profile warnings about the proliferation of ransomware worldwide, particularly via social media and phishing emails.In the Tasmanian stunt, devices show a pornographic pop-up along with a message confirming “infection.” Users are told to call a helpline number, with an operator on the other end telling them to pay for antivirus software. Only Bitcoin is accepted, and users are directed to a “local newsagency” to send payments, news resource The Mercury reports.While the antivirus product being sold is not named, accounts state that it is normally available for download free of charge.Law enforcement reactions demonstrate an additional hurdle in public awareness of Bitcoin - various comments reveal only limited understanding of how the digital currency works.“The transactions are mostly anonymous and there is no back up as there would be with a credit card payment or other regulated funds transfer,” Detective Sergeant Gen Hickman told The Mercury.He added that:“If you are asked to pay in Bitcoin or digital currency, you should be immediately cautious and seek help.”A lack of education on cybersecurity matters, especially those involving Bitcoin, has often been attributed to the negative press surrounding the cryptocurrency. Nonetheless, senior lawmakers in the US are now in part advocating the use of Bitcoin as a means to track and prevent criminal activity.In an interview with Forbes earlier this month, federal prosecutor Kathryn Haun said that anti-fraud methods, in particular, were a target sector for improvement with Blockchain technology immutable ledgers.At the same time, both a report and a survey published in November shows that 2016 has become a hotbed of activity for hackers using ransomware.80 percent of business respondents to a survey conducted by SentinelOne claimed to have been targeted, and where financial gain was involved, Bitcoin was often the method of choice for exacting payment in return for giving back control of data.",1
Fool Me Once: How to Spot a Cryptocurrency Scam,Iyke Aru,2016-11-14 18:10:00,9459,594,"Ignorance and greed have been described as the fuel that has powered the engine of most scams and financial malpractices.There is a growing trend within the cryptocurrency industry that portrays the characteristics of a time-bomb waiting to explode. Almost everywhere you turn, there is a certain coin to mine, a product to invest in, or a cryptocurrency based MLM that promises extraordinary payouts. The number of individuals who subscribe to these programs, on a daily basis, rises exponentially.Before this current wave of events, there have been similar cases where money making programs, that looked too good to be true, appeared and sucked people in, only to suddenly collapsed. Victims of such scams have always been left in pains and regrets, for those who lived through the disappointments.One question that remains to be answered is the reason why the public keeps falling for this agelong trick, despite their own previous painful experiences or those experienced by others within the space. Another major issue that persists is how to identify such schemes, for what they truly represent, in the early stages, especially as it relates to cryptocurrencies.According to Bob Wood, the founder and CEO of Nexxus Partners, scams of all kinds feed on two ingredients to create their perfect storm: ignorance and greed. Wood explains that new technologies are not understood by most people, enabling scammers to twist the facts just enough to include some truth mixed with deception, so as to occasionally fool individuals.Wood says:“If any guilt is to be found with most people, it is not for perpetuating a scam, but for not fully vetting the claims.”Wood points out that scams are often propagated within social circles based on trusted relationships, often in churches, work associates and other social groups. In such cases, he notes that the people often look to the reputation of the presenter, trusting that they would never try to cheat them, instead of asking what has been done to fully prove or disprove the opportunity claims.Wood categorizes cryptocurrency scams into two groups:According to Wood, the fundamental principles of cryptocurrency includes decentralization, privacy, unlimited use, controlled supply, and transparency with a public ledger, called a Blockchain, and publicly disclosed source code for anyone to verify. Any entity that does not satisfy these requirements cannot pass for a genuine cryptocurrency.The biggest culprit in this category, as noted by Wood, is Onecoin.“OneCoin is an illegal Ponzi scheme, promising unrealistic returns on investment that only come from new investor’s money,” he says.Wood has classified under this group, those cryptocurrencies that may have passed the fundamentally required principles but have failed to deliver value to the marketplace to drive buyer demand with a user benefit.Wood explains that building a cryptocurrency is usually a simple process and can be achieved within a couple of days for less than the cost of one Bitcoin. However, he says that the real challenge is building a market for the coin with an ecosystem to use the coin for real value exchange.The majority of the 3,534 cryptocurrency coins are listed here.Wood further explains that value creation is what companies must do in order to increase the price of their stock in the marketplace. A typical example that he points out is what Ethereum did with their own internal currency, the Ether coin.“Ethereum provides a development platform for Blockchain applications,” he explains.“Programmers pay Ethereum for the processing power that they consume in Ether coins. It’s actually a brilliant strategy to drive buyer demand for the Ether coin. This was reflected earlier this year when the Ether coin went from $0.50 to $21.50 in less than 6 months. That’s a good example of real value delivery.”Wood concludes by making clear that cryptocurrency is a grassroots movement that will create trillion dollar industries and reshape human culture. He says that it will also eventually enjoy transaction volumes approaching that of Visa and MasterCard. However, he advises that individuals should get the required education to be able to differentiate between a genuine opportunity and one which is not.",3
"MMM Global, OneCoin, Others Proving a Concern in Africa’s Bitcoin Market",Olusegun Ogundeji,2016-10-27 11:25:00,716,268,"One of the three most popular Bitcoin exchanges in the African market has warned its users on the need to be cautious of MMM Global and others offering similar schemes.Bitpesa is a Kenya-based exchange which also operates in Nigeria, Tanzania and Uganda. It now has a screaming message that would appeal to users on its webpage which says:“Bitpesa has recently become aware that MMM Global, Zarfund and similar services have begun operating in our markets. We are aware of many instances of customers of these services in other countries issuing complaints that these services have not always delivered on their promises and have left their customers with unexpected financial losses. We caution all of our customers to carefully consider all the investment opportunities and to be aware that they may be putting their investment at risk of total loss.”Bitpesa’s move follows a similar warning by another Africa-focused exchange, Bitx, for its users to be cautious of such schemes. Bitx says it also resorts to blocking users who tried to facilitate the payments to such schemes through the exchange based on a combination of certain keywords, suspicious Bitcoin addresses and other means.These exchanges are run by incorporated companies with records of legal transactions across the board. However, the same could not be said about the other schemes hence the concern.Over 66,000 MMM participants in Zimbabwe recently found their account balances slashed down to 1% of its previous value. Then the scheme reportedly collapsed in the country. In South Africa, a criminal investigation has been launched into MMM Global’s branch after a probe by the National Consumer Commission “found something” to suggest the scheme was acting illegally. Later in Nigeria, the country’s apex bank warned users not to deposit money in any institution that is not insured by the Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC).The irony is that despite these warnings and the reported cases of collapse, susceptible Africans who are bent on eking a living on their investment in these projects have not been deterred from responding positively to the mixed messages they have received about the activities of MMM Global and other schemes such as Onecoin, Zarfund in the past.  Onecoin business: why it's better than Bitcoin, says a page on one of Nigeria’s top female bloggers, Linda Ikeji. The blog, which runs among the top twenty most visited sites in the country, states how Onecoin is a digital currency based on advanced mathematical algorithms and allow members create the market, mine the coins and keep the profits.The ad says Onecoin is mined in mining pools (or teams) keeping individual investment in hardware etc. minimal, it uses KYC procedures and cannot be abused for illegal purposes like Bitcoin was and with a promise that Onecoin will be traded on a public exchange.However, some of these attributes are not functional yet, hence, the series of accusations on different fronts of Onecoin being a scam. More importantly, it has not been able to prove either that it has a source code, or a ledger where a record of its transactions are recorded and any exchange that trades in the coin.MMM Global, on the other hand, promises a 30% monthly increase for participants in its scheme which has made its offer be irresistible for many Africans irrespective of their social status, religious and cultural beliefs. They flock after the pyramid scheme’s get quick money but unsustainable approach - especially in Nairobi, Kenya where local branches are reported to be springing up quickly - as run by a convicted Russian fraudster, Sergey Mavrodi, who reportedly created the biggest finance pyramid in Russia before it collapsed in 1997.While there is a belief that these schemes’ objective is a way to beat established financial institutions to help the less privileged, others think that lack of awareness, greed, the growing middle class in some African countries and worsening economic situation in others, are responsible for the current level of their popularity.With the way several participants continue to defend the authenticity of these schemes through several means including testimonials on Youtube - others attempt to create a distinction between MMM Global and the seceded MMM United which its followers say is better than the main scheme, how to curtail their spread remains an issue that could be addressed presently. As long as it remains the case, exemplary use cases such as Bitpesa and Bitx will continue to struggle in the waiting game with their concern over operating in the market without any reason to fear for their users’ safety.",1
Bitcoin.com Owner Roger Ver Re-Echos OneCoin’s Scam Accusations,Frisco d'Anconia,2016-10-22 15:07:00,924,919,"In an interview with Cointelegraph, Roger Ver, Bitcoin.com owner, confirmed his conviction that the whole business idea was enveloped in fraud.However, Roger Ver lacks an opinion on whether OneCoin’s Recently launched “Blockchain” at a mammoth event in Bangkok is genuine or fake. Many have called it a deception and a little Shutterstock video that cost just €19.Ver says:“I don’t know enough about that to have an opinion. A lot of controversies have surrounded the company’s new Blockchain.”There has been a strong adverse reaction by a large number of people in the crypto space who think OneCoin is a Ponzi scheme, not a cryptocurrency. .Opinions are that the nature of Dr. Ruja’s digital currency does not exhibit cryptocurrency. “There is never a cryptocurrency without a wallet. This sounds like more evidence of its fraudulent nature. OneCoin isn’t traded on a single exchange anywhere in the world as far as I know,” Ver reiterates the opinion of so many others.Moreover, one particular coin that is missing on the Coin Market Cap is OneCoin. This, therefore, raises a lot of doubts and unanswered questions. To Ver, the claim by Dr. Ruja that her new Blockchain mined more than 1.9 bln coins in 60 seconds does not make any sense at all.Most Bitcoin enthusiasts and investors who have expressed their displeasure about the matter believe OneCoin’s operation can drag the image of the pioneer cryptocurrency in the mud.In Juxtaposition, Ver surmised if Onecoin goes down it cannot drag Bitcoin’s image along. He believes it will rather enhance Bitcoin. “I think it would help Bitcoin since most Bitcoin users have been pointing out that OneCoin is a scam for a long time now,” he says.Ver is, therefore, urging the public especially the digital currency community to make good use of due diligence when investing in any company.In fact, this is a paramount call that must not be ignored by all and sundry. “Don’t invest in anything you don’t understand,” concludes the man, who does not like the nickname Bitcoin Jesus given to him by some members of the Blockchain fraternity.",8
"Apple Approves Two Scam-Like Bitcoin Apps Again, Due Diligence in Question",Joseph Young,2016-10-11 12:40:00,418,206,"Recently Apple approved two applications called Ocean and AlphaWallet that are structurally designed to steal Bitcoin from users. Although Apple has been removing a substantial number of suspicions apps on its app store, the consistent emergence of obvious scam applications are beginning to concern the Bitcoin community.IPhone and other Apple device users have had serious issues with scam Bitcoin applications on the Apple App store that are designed to extract and steal user funds. The company’s inability to filter scam-like apps is creating a poor ecosystem for Bitcoin users.The ostensible legitimacy of the apps in terms of branding, UI, design, and functionalities will most likely deceive many beginner Bitcoin users, who may utilize it to store large amounts of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum.A series similar situations occurred back in August and July, when over 15 scam applications including imitations of BitGo, Coinbase and Green Wallets with slight logo changes were released.Some argue that users must be more aware of these scam-like applications rather than accusing Apple of false approval. However, considering the strict and long authentication procedure of Apple in releasing apps on its app store, the surfacing of the scams raise suspicions about the role of Apple itself.The Apple application verification process takes anywhere from 1 to 31 days, depending on the category and structure of the applications. Most apps go through a 2-week verification process, which is sufficient for Apple staff to discover whether an application is legitimate or not.The fact that over 20 scam applications have penetrated the strict app filter and verification process is alarming to Bitcoin users and must be taken seriously by the Apple staff. If illegitimate applications continue to be released, it will lead to larger losses of funds amongst Apple device users utilizing Bitcoin to make payments.",1
Keep Money in the Game: OneCoin Moves On To New Fantasy Blockchain,Frisco d'Anconia,2016-10-06 12:33:00,2904,888,"On October 1, OneCoin, a self-declared cryptocurrency and trading venture based out of Bulgaria, has announced at a conference in Bangkok, Thailand that it switches to the “new Blockchain”, “transferring coins” from the old one to the new one.OneCoin has been in focus of Cointelegraph for some time. Recently the authorities of the UK and Sweden has warned investors that OneCoin is suspected to be a pyramid scheme with no verifiable evidence to back up any of its business claims.According to Tim Tayshun, CEO of Ezcoin, OneCoin is pure fraud and deception. He gave Cointelegraph his version of events that took place during the conference when OneCoin had mysteriously doubled the coin of every member.When asked whether OneCoin really delivered a new Blockchain to its clients, Tim Tayshun said:  “To 8,500 or so Onecoin cult members attending an event that day, the answer would be a resounding yes.”Tim Tayshun continues his story: “Even a day prior to the event, Joby Boughey, formerly involved in the U-Token/U-Fun affair stated in a video on his Facebook page, that after today “nobody will say it’s a scam!” Ken Labine, Canada’s #1 Onecoin dealer, had similar things to say. However, upon closer inspection even my own jaw dropped at the tremendous caper being orchestrated live at the “OneLife Mastermind Event” at the Impact Arena in Bangkok, Thailand. It was midnight California time when the fun began and the “chat box” on the live video stream was opened for all...”Ruja Ignatova, CEO of OneCoin claimed that the mining taking place was being shown live onstage on their new Blockchain. Tim Tayshun thinks that was untrue: “What we could clearly see is that the only thing that was “switched on” was a flashing banner over THIS LOOPED VIDEO.”As Tim Tayshun recalls, there was no explanation whatsoever of how or if the old coins were transferred to the new Blockchain. He also thinks that it is impossible to mine so many coins within just a minute:“It was claimed that in roughly 60 seconds, the first Genesis block of the new Blockchain ‘mined’ 1,986,580,000 coins. This is nearly 100x (94.5x) the amount of Bitcoin that will ever have been created over the next 124 years when the last Satoshi is finally rewarded sometime around the year of 2140.”  Tim Tayshun noted that Ruja announced the coin will go public during the second quarter of 2018. Tim doesn’t believe it: “OneCoin claims every coin is worth $7.80, and each OneCoin block will disperse exactly 50,000 coins per minute. The total market cap of top 100 Cryptocurrencies is $12,210,633,867. OneCoin is saying the new Blockchain will be pumping out coins worth more than the market cap of the top 100 crypto-currencies combined – every 30 days”.“So, by snapping her fingers and waving her magic wand and yelling, “Go! Go! Go! Mine!” Ruja is projecting one trillion Dollars worth of coins in 5 years - says Tim Tayshun. - OneCoin logic doesn’t even try to make sense.”Cointelegraph asked Tim Tayshun to explain how the OneCoin system is working. Tim Tayshun says:“As we all know, each Ponzi playbook is this: Keep money in the game as long as possible.”He continues: “Onecoin/ OneLife Network requires new investor money coming in to pay out existing investors. Otherwise, the well will run dry and the unsustainable scheme will collapse. Onecoin/ OneLife have invented clever ways of doing this. Mostly, it is to encourage users to “roll their winnings” into the next package up, or even the same package (ie., 2-3 or more Tycoon Packages at 5,000 Euro each are advantageous for speculating investors) which come with more tokens and higher “mining” incentives, splits and other nonsense. And the claim that OneCoin sells “Education Packages” is utter nonsense. Onecoin/ One Life have recently tried to entice new victims with packages costing as much as 27,500€ and even 118,000€!  Which resulted in the related YouTube video having been taken down for violating rules on scams.”Tim Tayshun continues:“Through a variety of magic splits, doubling, auto-mines and other fantasy crypto-technology terms, investors were promised a ROI of over 2,000,000 coins worth over $14 million. Onecoin’s uses of KYC actually as well as not having a wallet betrays their ignorance of cryptocurrency. Moreover, you can only withdraw a fraction of your deposit. That means OneCoin is not a cryptocurrency. How they can bring on board one million merchants without a wallet? Does Johnny Burger King at the cash drawer have to register his ID to accept payments, or does he have to call the boss at one of the other stores? Do these “Leaders” just blurt out the first half-baked idea that comes to their head?”“95% of victims will be shocked at their own ignorance and for not seeing and listening to so many warning signs, says Tim. Only about 12.5% will even make back their initial investment, meaning that 87.5% will lose any money they have invested. Some of that percentage will lose everything, including their home and life savings, as I know of people who have literally put up mortgages gambling on a get-rich-with-little-work philosophy.”  According to Tim Tayshun, bringing the people behind OneCoin to book should be the focus of the cryptocurrency community in order not to jeopardize the genuine cryptocurrencies out there. He says:“For the real digital money community and for Blockchain enthusiasts, the best we can do is to not let mainstream media and regulatory bodies (ie., Govt.’s) look at this as another Mt. Gox (but much bigger), and try to create stricter regulations, laws, compliance and oversight which will only stifle innovation in this field and make it more expensive for start-ups and honest players in the space to continue pushing the boundaries of this technology. The community will need to push to convey the understanding that this has nothing whatsoever to do with cryptocurrency or the Blockchain technology. That has always been one of my greatest worries when watching this unfold.”",59
Monero Loses Darknet Market in Apparent Exit Scam,Joël Valenzuela,2016-10-05 16:55:00,4780,593,"Monero appears to have lost its darknet market integrations, and very well may have fallen victim to an exit scam.Darknet market Oasis, the first to accept Monero, has abruptly gone offline in an apparent exit scam, making off with customer funds. An estimated 150 Bitcoins were lost, as well as an indeterminate amount of Monero.Several users report that attempts to withdraw XMR from AlphaBay, the darknet market whose integration was closely correlated with the currency’s meteoric rise, were unresponsive as well.HolladsHerbs, Reddit user, posted in the /r/DarkNetMarkets subreddit a theory that Oasis first accepted Monero in order to pump up the currency to make a significant profit:“Everyone is looking at the 150 BTC Oasis made from their exit scam while in fact Oasis probably made most of their money from their Pump&Dump (tm) game they pulled of with their Monero stunt.They where[sic] the first market to support Monero and they also where[sic] the first to know Monero was going to get accepted on the dark-web. By simply taking long positions and buying loads of Monero just before they made their announcement they most likely made huge amounts of money, way more than 150 Bitcoins.”The web wallet for Monero, MyMonero run by famed XMR developer FluffyPony, has been unresponsive for several days, according to several users on Reddit. Users reportedly were unable to withdraw funds and have contacted support days ago, with no response. Users are still able to import private keys to another wallet to secure their funds.MyMonero wallets have been targeted in several large thefts, resulting in millions of dollars worth stolen this year. The evidence at this point is inconclusive as to whether the thefts resulted from security vulnerabilities in individual users’ machines, or from the wallet itself.Fake site MyMonero.co (as opposed to .com) has a warning posted about the hacks, theorizing that the wallet itself is vulnerable, although insisting that MyMonero operator FluffyPony is not himself culpable.The rapid rise to the top rankings Monero experienced recently was closely correlated with the AlphaBay darknet market integration as the privacy-centric cryptocurrency took over Bitcoin’s unique user base, a limited demographic concerned with financial anonymity above all.However, excess concentration on single points of failure, in this case a focus on a couple darknet markets as well as only operating one web wallet, resulted in the bubble popping. This has already resulted in a 50% drop in XMR’s price.Update: Since this article's publication, AlphaBay has responded that they are up and running, that interruptions in Monero transactions were due to a software upgrade.",72
UK Financial Conduct Authority Issues Warning Against OneCoin,Joseph Young,2016-09-29 11:30:00,544,423,"The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), an independent public body that is accountable to Treasury and parliament, officially issued a warning against OneCoin operations.Earlier this month, the Swedish Bitcoin Foundation warned its cryptocurrency community and industry regarding the scam-like structure of OneCoin, a “pyramide” built on illegitimate cryptography and security measures.The FCA is the second important government-related public body in 2016 to launch an official investigation on OneCoin.Government agencies and organizations globally are becoming more aware of the structures of scam-like cryptocurrencies, and are requesting law enforcement agencies to conduct in-depth investigations to expose controversial cryptocurrencies that aren’t built and designed to serve as forms of money.The UK government and its law enforcement understands that OneCoin or any other cryptocurrencies doesn’t require authorization from the local government to operate. However, the City of London Police and the FCA believe if schemes like OneCoin are taking advantage of the rising trend in cryptocurrency to extract money from its users, they are obligated by both local and international financial regulations and policies to interfere with their operations.“This firm is not authorised by us and we do not believe it is undertaking any activities that require our authorisation. However, we are concerned about the potential risks this firm poses to UK consumers,” stated the FCA.The organization further emphasized that users must be more cautious in approaching the cryptocurrency particularly since it is not authorized by the FCA. That means, users of OneCoin are not subjected to compensation schemes supported by the government.“As OneCoin is not authorised, consumers who deal with it will have no protection from the Financial Ombudsman Service or the Financial Services Compensation Scheme,” added the FCA.Although government or central authority’s interference with cryptocurrencies and independent financial networks often lead to harmful effects on the financial sector, positive approach from the UK’s FCA in protecting its consumers from Ponzi schemes sets an appropriate precedent and standard for the cryptocurrency industry worldwide.",[]
Blockchain Could Have Prevented The Wells Fargo Scam,Iyke Aru,2016-09-22 16:35:00,415,437,"A major factor which played a part in the Wells Fargo scam was poor and non-transparent data management. Could implementation of the Blockchain have helped in preventing the occurrence of such fraudulent activities?The unethical behaviour by Wells Fargo has generated a lot of reaction from both the legal and the financial institutions in recent weeks. Wells Fargo employees secretly created millions of unauthorized bank and credit card accounts without their customers knowing it. The illegal accounts earned the bank unwarranted fees and allowed Wells Fargo employees to boost their sales figures and make more money.Wells Fargo claims to have fired 5,300 employees over the last few years related to this behaviour, but US Senator Elizabeth Warren insists that the management team must be held responsible for their inability to keep track of the procedures within the system.“My view on this is one of two things, either they knew or they didn’t know. In which case, how can you run a giant multinational bank where you are supposed to keep track of people’s money, safety and security and not know what more than 5,000 of your employees are doing? If they really didn’t know, then that tells me that this is a bank that is simply too big to manage.” Says Warren.The Founder of Coinfirm Blockchain Lab, Grant Blaisdell, tells Cointelegraph that certain characteristics of the Blockchain such as client identity and KYC processes could be of help in the future. Blaisdell say:“I see it in a few ways. First, at this point in time, it's kind of abstract but in the very near future it probably won't be, but it would require that banks truly built a wider infrastructure on Blockchain beyond what is heavily discussed today. But two ideas could help. One is that client identity, KYC process etc are registered in the Blockchain, and all activity related to that client ID is tied to that Blockchain and then, for example, a client can then transparently see what activity is tied to their ID. On top of that, any activity would have to be approved by their private key. And all of this could be put into their bank app.”However, the CEO of EC District, Aleksandar Matanovic, sees the Wells Fargo case as more of a legal issue, rather than a technological one. Matanovic believes that the most effective way to correct such an anomaly would be by punishing offenders.He says:“As long as bankers easily get away with it, we will keep having such incidents. When someone starts putting bankers in prison for scams, they (the bankers) will think twice before doing something like this (the Wells Fargo scam). So, for me, it is more of a legal issue than it is a technological one.”",1
"One Coin, Much Scam: Swedish Bitcoin Foundation Issues Warning Against OneCoin",Joseph Young,2016-09-14 17:52:00,5471,2062,"The Swedish Bitcoin Foundation calls OneCoin, a cryptocurrency that has been around since early 2015, “a pyramide”, “a fraud” and warns against dealing with it.Mats Henricson, the chairman of the Swedish Bitcoin Foundation, wrote in an official statement that the organization believes OneCoin is a fraud and that users who are relatively new to digital currencies and the cryptocurrency industry must be cautious when approaching OneCoin-related programs.Henricson said:“OneCoin has grown immensely large and billions have been put into this phenomenon. But OneCoin is not like the other crypto currencies such as Bitcoin.”He further stated that the technical aspects of the “cryptocurrency” is vulnerable and broken, while the economical side of OneCoin proves its fraudulent “pyramid scheme-like” structure.He added:“We therefore conclude that OneCoin is a fraud and therefore call for caution.”OneCoin gained serious momentum in late 2015, as users began to invest millions of dollars into the digital currency expecting some sort of guaranteed profits which they were promised. Users were particularly allured by the OneCoin development team, who falsely stated that the cryptocurrency was being utilized by millions of people worldwide.The cryptocurrency became increasingly popular amongst beginner cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors who lacked significant knowledge in cryptography in general and the fundamentals of digital currencies.To begin with, OneCoin is not an open-source software. Despite the OneCoin development team’s claims, none of OneCoin’s codes were released via platforms like Github, most likely due the fear and concerns of the development team that other experts in the field might expose the broken cryptography behind the cryptocurrency.More importantly, OneCoin is not based on a public ledger. Its transactions can’t be tracked elsewhere and it doesn’t represent decentralization as other cryptocurrencies do, like Bitcoin & Monero. It is even difficult to categorize OneCoin as a cryptocurrency due to its ambiguous structure and its core infrastructure that isn’t based on a public and open Blockchain.According to Behind MLM, a multi-level marketing research organization, the Onecoin structure can be summarised in three main points:“The first is a simple recruitment-driven pyramid scheme, backed with a residual binary compensation structure. Affiliates join OneCoin and are then directly compensated on the recruitment of new affiliates, who must spend money on packages to participate in the MLM opportunity.The second is the whole Aurum Gold Coins schtick, which appears to be an alternative virtual currency to the OneTokens, and are backed by baloney.The third and most secretive component is the OneCoin token share scheme.”The establishment of active cryptocurrency organizations like the Swedish Bitcoin Foundation help the creation and improvement of enhanced ecosystems for both businesses and users in the digital currency industry.The efforts of the Swedish Bitcoin Foundation in taking the necessary steps to warn local cryptocurrency users against scams and Ponzi schemes should be appreciated and supported by the community.",63
"Wells Fargo Scam Proves Banks Are Rotten to the Core, Time to Opt for Bitcoin",Joseph Young,2016-09-11 12:00:00,693,735,"The Los Angeles City Attorney and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau fined Wells Fargo US$185 million for creating fake bank accounts to meet their sales targets. The incident presented a convincing case for Bitcoin and its ability to grant users complete control over their money.Wells Fargo, officially the world’s largest bank at US$254 billion market cap, recently released more than 5,000 employees for creating fake bank accounts to increase the company’s sales. To satisfy their sales goals, employees created a staggering 2 million fake bank accounts and then moved customer’s money around in an attempt to prove its legitimacy.The movement of customer’s funds from these fake bank accounts led to a series of substantially high overdraft fees, which are one-time fees charged by the bank for each bank account, if, and when, an account balance reaches below zero. After the incident, millions of Wells Fargo customers each received around US$140 in overdraft fees, along with other fees and charges which the bank plans to disclose once the investigation closes.John Stumpf, Wells Fargo CEO, who made around US$19.3 million in compensation alone in 2015, and other company executives weren’t held accountable for the incident.While 5,300 Wells Fargo employees were immediately released after the fraudulent operation was publicized, bankers of the year, Stumpf, and his predecessor, Dick Kovacevich, were protected by the company which led to an outrage of criticism from experts and those in the financial community.Eric Schiffer, TV personality and Two inc. CEO, stated:Stumpf should be fired for the Wells Fargo horror show. It led to bullets piercing Wells like a suicidal wild west gunslinger in action.Unlike popular banking systems, Bitcoin offers full control of money to its users. That means investors and traders who hold Bitcoin in a wallet platform will have full control over their funds, eliminating the possibility of a central authority or a network administrator moving the funds around certain accounts without the user’s permission.The entire incident involving Wells Fargo and its customers could have been avoided if the customers hadn’t granted the bank complete control over their money and the rights to move their funds.As today’s banking systems and mechanisms become exposed, a more convincing case for Bitcoin and its decentralized nature is being presented to mainstream users.",8
Steemit or Synereo? Comparing Decentralized Social Networks,Olusegun Ogundeji,2016-08-25 17:32:00,2285,269,"A new bitcointalk thread is currently raising issues which basically make comparisons between Steemit and Synereo.Though virtually every project in the industry has had some random allegations against them, the thread which was started on Friday August 19 was supposedly prompted by the recent announcement by Synereo that its Alpha version will be going online next month.Steem is the digital currency behind the Steemit social media platform which rewards content  posters and voters online. Steemit was recently hacked with some accounts compromised. Steem overtook The DAO to be the world’s fifth most valuable cryptocurrency following its 1000% plus growth in the days following Steemit’s first cryptocurrency payout on July 4.  Synereo, on the other hand, proposes a semi-autonomous system which requires human involvement in the roles defined in smart contracts. Synereo offers a social model - one that integrates measures of compassion in its code, no censorship and provides users the opportunity to monetize their content and own their organic local network.With the title, Synereo same Ponzi scam like Steem?, the OP dranster started the discussion line with an assumption that “SYNEREO AMP might be the same pyramid scheme like Steem because they “Both have similar monetization techniques...AMP has a large premine like 90%” and sought the view of forum members.  The first responder who claims to have been following Synereo and its developers since its ICO, and how they helped Ethereum with its new proof-of-stake protocol, dispelled the assumption as doubtful. Dsattler wrote: “The core devs are deeply involved in the crypto scene and it's highly unlikely that they put their reputation at risk with a Ponzi.”DecentralizeEconomics cited the fully decentralized form of Synereo as the main difference with Steemit as a centralized platform and hinted at a possible self-orchestrated collapse of Steem.Several scam accusations have been run all over the place, but it is always better to wait and let the technology being used by every startup or platform speak for itself.Matej Michalko, Founder and Director at DECENT (Decentralizing Content Distribution), waved the scam accusations aside saying they are not new.He tells Cointelegraph:“Being an insider in the domain of Blockchain digital content distribution for some time, I have seen many groundless accusations merely based on dubious evidence. Most of them have been posted by people unwilling to disclose their real names for various reasons. I believe that Blockchain technologies have great potential to liberate the world of unnecessary middlemen, reduce transaction costs and do a great service to humanity. Blockchain Tech is a high technology that is still at a very early stage and has not yet crossed the chasm to mainstream markets. Projects in this space should join forces and co-operate to render Blockchain mainstream.”However, in an email to Cointelegraph, Ned Scott, Steemit CEO, says that Steem is a decentralized Blockchain which is leveraging segregated and isolated witness node operations from around the world through Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS) consensus. He explains that the centrally held Delaware corporation, Steemit, is not a Blockchain; instead, it is a Blockchain-based web application, much like Blockchain.info, with more than sixty web applications leveraging the Steem Blockchain to date.Another forum member prompted DecentralizeEconomics to support the claim that Steem will collapse because it is centrally supported by an entity which has reportedly been cashing out.The writer says:“If I want to use a centralized website for social networking, I'll use Facebook and Twitter which already have mass adoption. Steem is simply an overly complex scheme intentionally designed to steal from the under-informed.  Ask yourself, ""If the website is centrally hosted, how do they intend on dealing with take-down requests?""  They don't, because they don't plan on Steem lasting this long.  It's a quick money grab, and that's it.  With Synereo, nothing is centrally hosted and none of the decentralized nodes in the network know what is being stored on their disks, because everything is encrypted.”Banano added that while Steemit is the “Wonder Bread of social media, Synereo will be the place for controversial content similar to Wikileaks and Snowden!” adding that the fact Steemit is “Mathematically guaranteed to collapse” has been widely published online.“Just a black box to take a flyer on”Despite highlighted flaws in the amount of ""Steem Power"" the founders reserved for themselves and it’s not being an open source, d5000 says some of “the underlying fundament(al)s of Steem are actually good and well thought-out.”Zer0Sum claimed Steem “was ninja-mined among widespread disinterest just like BTC,” adding that leadership and decentralization are mutually exclusive but cites a concern that Steemit has no real content plan or roadmap as social networks don't evolve ""organically"" but are planned, targeted and built brick-by-brick. The writer added that Steemit could succeed if they become highly focused while claiming that “Synereo is just a black box to take a flyer on.”Ned Scott says that Steemit is currently working to improve the website and contribute to the open source development of the blockchain, as well as provide support to entrepreneurs building third party apps.He explains:“Steemit has developed a roadmap that outlines how we and other Steem-based businesses can begin to connect six ecosystem verticals for full-stack Blockchain-based social networks from Blockchain Payments and Rewards, Social Media  and Networking, Identity Management, Account Recoveries and Password Recoveries, Steem-integrated Marketplace and Private messaging, Sidechains, WREN Virtual Machine and Plug-ins, to Smart Contracts, Advertisements and Promoted Content.  In the near term, users should expect better and better performance of Steemit.com’s social media features.”Christopher Franko, a Blockchain expert at Expanse.tech, says to Cointelegraph that he has a Steemit account and really likes the platform. However, the one thing that really bothers him is how inorganic and unbalanced the distribution of power is.He notes:“Early on, it was obvious who wields all the authority in the system. In Steemit they are known as ""whales"". The ""whales"" are made up of the lead developer and a couple of his friends who essentially act as gatekeepers. The whales use their voting power to condition very specific content creators and public figures with thousands of dollars, with the hopes that these people will act as brand ambassadors which has been working.”Frank adds that he has personally witnessed hordes of otherwise intelligent people championing this platform because ""they and their friends are winning at it, so they like it."" Usually these people are handpicked and invited to the platform by the creators themselves. Users with less clout affectionately known as ""minnows"" amount to basically nothing. They have absolutely no value attributed to their vote.He explains:“The platform boasts as having over 60000 users but only 247 accounts hold  ~87.50% amount of the voting power. Steemit is a cool idea which falls short on implementation as it relies solely on its users’ urge to ""get rich quickly"", their F.O.M.O, trickledown economics, and a cumbersome cash-out process known as ""powering down"" to keep the platform moving forward.”Scott rejoins, saying that the Steemit reward system is based on Subjective Proof of Work algorithms that reward subjectively-valued posts and accurate voting. These tenants are core and distinguishing features of Steem.Steemit CEO notes:“The voting rewards algorithm combines a 30-minute window of review opportunity for readers, with fewer rewards reaped closer to 0 minutes, combined with a wisdom-of-the-crowd factor that benefits those who vote for posts which end up becoming highly upvoted. The earlier that Steem-holders vote for posts within the 30-minute window, the more posters are directly rewarded. On the whole, posters earn at least three-quarters of the total rewards for a post and voters earn at most one-quarter. Rewards for posters are distributed as 50% Steem Power and 50% Steem Dollars, while rewards for voters are distributed as 100% Steem Power.”",3
Major Bitcoin/Ethereum Exchange: Ethereum Classic is a Scam,Evander Smart,2016-07-28 21:28:00,2796,234,"It seems all year long, the digital currency community has been abuzz over Ethereum. From its meteoric rise in January, moving from less than #1 USD in value to over $15 USD by mid-February, to the innovative, but ill-fated DAO experiment, Ethereum has been all over the news.This won’t abate anytime soon, as the recent fork and emergence of an “Ethereum Classic” has created a new storm of controversy, leading one leading Bitcoin exchange to attack.Digital currency exchange BTC-e posted on their website’s latest news entry that they see major problems with Ethereum Classic. They made an urgent call to their users late last night after conferring with Poloniex recently about Ethereum Classic movement.BTC-e states:“Dear Clients! BTC-e’s official standpoint on this issue is as follows: Ethereum Classic in the current circumstances is a scam. The Ethereum community decided to implement the hard fork in order to switch to the new chain. All major pools and exchanges (including BTC-e) did exactly that.”BTC-e says they have been working with Poloniex on the transfer of ETC on behalf of their customers, and they had virtually no ETC on-hand. Poloniex was looking to find a secure place for the cache of two-day-old ETC.They explain in the post:“We continue to receive requests from our customers demanding to return the ETCs that are supposedly deposited in our ETH wallet. We cannot do that for the reason specified above. Anyone, who purports that we sent the coins to Poloniex in order to sell them, can check all the transactions on the blockchain. All transactions are recorded and it is easy to trace the sender and the volumes of coins sent.”According to CoinMarketCap.com, ETC is trading at just under $2 USD while Ethereum is just under $13 USD, an effective value split of their combined value recently, before the fork.Some have called this latest development within the Ethereum community a “Fiasco.” This development will not curb such allegations.",30
Bitcoin Scam vs. Ethereum Scam: Which Is Easier To Get Away With?,Iyke Aru,2016-07-26 12:39:00,1038,156,"With a Court in Manhattan sentencing a Bitcoin scammer to one and half years in prison, experts say it is a move in the right direction and would instill a higher level of sanity within the digital currency ecosystem.Several schemes surrounding the crypto world has taken advantage of the growth in awareness of digital currency to defraud unsuspecting individuals.With many self-acclaimed investment opportunities littering the internet, cases of scam and Ponzi schemes have become a common occurrence in recent times.OneFxZone and HashOcean are two of such schemes that have been uncovered recently by Cointelegraph. However the events at a Manhattan court on Thursday July 21 2016 seems a step in the right direction in fighting internet scam, especially as it affects digital currencies.Trendon Shavers, who operated a Bitcoin Savings and Trust was sentenced to one and half years in prison, and also ordered to forfeit $1.23 million and pay restitution in the same amount for operating what was called a “class Ponzi scheme”. This sentence was delivered by a US District Judge, Lewis Kaplan in a Manhattan court.Speaking to Cointelegraph about the impact of this judgement on the crypto space, George Basiladze, the Founder of the UK payment gateway Cryptopay, thinks it is high time a precedent is set.He says:“I think that this case emerged in a very timely manner - there are hundreds of bitcoin ponzi schemes and investment scams on the market. Now, there is a official statement - fraudsters will be punished, even scammers within the bitcoin community. Beware!”The President of Bitwage, Jonathan Chester points out what he thinks are the salient aspects of the judgment.Chester explains that by the standards of the United states, it was clear that Shavers was operating an illegal ponzi scheme.Chester says:“Clearly, by United States standards, Trendon Shavers was operating an illegal ponzi scheme. Regardless of his use of bitcoins, his operations were illegal. In fact, he caused investors to lose $1.23m. It is important to understand the legal landscape of the jurisdiction you are working in and it is even more important to constantly have consumer protection at top of mind. Regardless of whether or not Shavers had bad intentions, he clearly portrayed gross negligence on both of these fronts.”Another point noted by Chester is the fact that most governments are very amicable to innovation and want to foster an environment to allow for innovation. Hence, the government’s responsibility to protect her citizens.Chester explains:“I actually was sitting down for lunch with various members of the european parliament the other day who were visiting silicon valley to learn how they can foster the innovation mindset of silicon valley throughout europe. However, when consumer protection is involved, governments, especially developed nations, typically get involved, even in nascent industries. This is particularly true if malintent is involved. It is important for the government to take action against people who leverage a new technology in a way that is designed to hurt people for personal gain. We are paying governments with taxes to protect us after all.”According to Chester, it is interesting to think that maybe it is harder for a fraudster or a thief to get away with a major scam in Ethereum. Chester explains that this can clearly be evidenced in the recent hard fork to fix what happened with the $50m DAO heist.He concludes:“Because the Ethereum ecosystem is currently so small, it is not very hard to enforce changes to the state of the ledger. Should a scammer attempt to pull another heist, there could possibly be another hard fork for the sake of consumer protection.”This may actually push more scammers to Bitcoin. It may also mean that Ethereum is more easily influenced by government regulators wanting to control the payment system.",1
ShapeShift Thief Begins to Move Stolen Bitcoin,Joël Valenzuela,2016-07-09 12:05:00,977,154,"The Bitcoin stolen from cryptocurrency exchange ShapeShift has begun to move.In March of 2016, a hacker, aided by a rogue employee, stole more than $230,000 worth of cryptocurrency from ShapeShift. Most of it has not been recovered, and the perpetrator has not yet been identified.Erik Voorhees, CEO of ShapeShift, kept the general public appraised as to the situation during and after the hacking incident.On June 30th, the stolen funds were moved to two separate addresses, one in a $205,666 chunk and the other in a $654 chunk. Each one of these addresses shows only two transactions: the receipt of the funds, and the subsequent transmission of those funds to two separate addresses. This continues on seemingly endlessly, as each new transaction is separated into two and sent to two new, empty addresses so as to cover the thief’s tracks.All Bitcoin transactions are publicly viewable via the blockchain. However, since addresses are not tied to any specific identity, and new ones may be created easily, the obfuscation of financial transfers becomes very doable. Coin mixing services send coins to and from many addresses so that their final destination, and origin, remains unclear, thereby maintaining privacy. Dash has a coin mixing service built in, performed by its masternodes.Since the attack, ShapeShift has pledged to rebuild and recover. No customer funds were stolen during the hacks, and ShapeShift’s infrastructure has since been rebuilt.",1
"HashOcean Scam Victims Sign Petitions to FBI, Hackers to Reveal More Scams",Olusegun Ogundeji,2016-07-02 13:59:00,6634,232,"Three separate online petitions have been opened by individuals who have reportedly lost their investments in the defunct HashOcean Bitcoin mining company. They are seeking to get the interest of the relevant transborder crimes department of law enforcement agencies such as the FBI, CIA, Interpol and MI6.The petitions include FBI - EUA: FIND HASHOCEAN.COM by Hugo Trombini in Brazil, FBI - EUA - CIA - MI-6 - INTERPOL: FIND OWNER HASHOCEAN.COM by Adam A. from the United Kingdom and FBI And Interpol Hashocean 700,000 people swindled by Gonzalo D. from Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires, Argentina. The three campaigns have gathered over a thousand signatures so far.Hugo Trombini has also opened a Facebook page Find Hashocean where he seeks to gain support of other HashOcean scam victims on the need to ‘centralize information’ to achieve a common goal which is to get those behind the website.  Trombini, for example, says he has made efforts to contact organizations of interest with the hope of sharing the information he has, including IP addresses and contact details. With these details he thinks it will help to trace and locate those behind the vanished site.His petition campaign says:“The website HashOcean.com is off-line and took with them millions of dollars from approximately 700,000 users worldwide. Since there are neither regulating institutions nor reliable sources of information, we have decided to open this channel to all users and supporters of cloud mining - people who believe in a transparent mining process. We created this petition to be able to ask the FBI and other similar institutions to trace those in charge of www.HashOcean.com - Cloud Mining. 700,000 users want their money back and the supporters of Cloud Mining deserve a reliable mining process.If you lost money with www.HashOcean.com - Cloud Mining or you are simply a cryptocurrency supporter, please help us to raise awareness and get specialist help to trace the people responsible for HashOcean.com. Please sign the petition and forward to as many people as possible in all social medias. Let´s unite and raise awareness as soon as possible.”In a Facebook chat with Cointelegraph, Trombini said he started the campaign because he had lost about $10,000 dollars - everything he had and six months of work: “I see others want justice, so I started to search for my own.”On why he directed his petition to the FBI and what he expects them to do he said:“The first thing I thought was: they have a well-structured department. They have a large team for these sorts of cases. As crypto coins are a money of the world, I think they don’t want this money to go into arms and drugs, and neither do I. So I think many people put all this money into the system and now they are very sad.”He said he will be disappointed if the FBI does not find the HashOcean team or choose not to find them.He explains:“If they find them, we will then have an example and we can create some parameters to determine if a site or a mining cloud company is a scam or not. We have to set minimum rules to trust a website or a cloud mining site like a registry or something to tell us that this farm is working ok. So if the FBI can’t find or don’t want to find them, I think then anyone can create their own scam, and nothing will happen to them.”According to Kypertech hackers, the HashOcean.com site is now worth $44m and is up for grabs. In response to a claim that says the group’s Polish hacker could be hacking the original HashOcean website, the group posts on its Facebook page:“Wow! So now people are blaming us for ‪#‎hashocean‬ shutting down while we have been doing nothing but trying to fix things!?! Our Polish hacker didn't even touch their website until AFTER IT WAS DOWN. People will say anything to get a fix nowadays. We did not originally ‘hack’ hashocean. THEY PARKED THEIR DOMAIN AND ARE TRYING TO SELL IT WHICH, IF WE MIGHT ADD, IS CURRENTLY WORTH $44 MILLION DOLLARS.”Kypertech advises that miners should be careful with any further dealings with cloud miners.The hackers say about other cloud mining sites:“For those interested, we are not recommending cloud mining sites at this time. We have already found four more sites which are still running, yet are scams, according to forums we have found on the deep web. Our list of them will follow soon. Please refrain from posting links of sites with referral links because we CANNOT validate these sites and with the current trend of shutting down, it seems no site is safe. Even though you have been paid out for months or it looks legit we all know what happened when we said the same about ‪#‎hashocean‬.”",[]
How Investors Can Protect Themselves Against Bitcoin Scams,Iyke Aru,2016-06-29 16:05:00,501,196,"To safeguard themselves from scams within the cryptocurrency ecosystem, investors must avoid being greedy, be logical in their analysis of opportunities and dedicate time and resources to research and education.Complaints about loss of investments within the crypto space is becoming a common occurrence. As a result,  online investment companies which deal with cryptocurrencies have recently become increasingly perceived with a negative bias. Scammers these days seem to ride on the anonymous characteristics of the industry to deceive unsuspecting investors.The latest incidence involved a supposed Bitcoin cloud mining company Hashocean whose website was inaccessible for about five days. Also, among the supposed scammers is OneFxZone, a self-acclaimed trading company who still claim to be honest, but their investors complain of their inability to access their funds.Cointelegraph asked experts why scams now seem to be on the increase and how potential investors can figure out which prospect is genuine and which is not.Co-Founder and Director at SatoshiLabs, Alena Vranova tells Cointelegraph that the rise of scams and Bitcoin thefts come hand-in-hand with the rising price of Bitcoin.“The correlation was shown clearly in the Dell Secure Works research conducted in early 2014.”Vranova identifies the three most common areas where Bitcoin thefts or scams occur as: through a third-party fraud, digital exposure and human error or ignorance. She says that the digital and third-party risks can be easily mitigated today with a hardware wallet such as TREZOR while distributing the risk is usually a good common practice in any investment.  “Some voices call for more regulation against fraudsters exploiting poorly informed clients. I am quite opposed to that idea. In  any financial services and investment opportunities, a fraud is very common, and the Bitcoin world is not an exception. As a ‘small’ example we can look at the insurance industry. The UK represents over 7% of the global insurance market and faces over 2 billion pounds in insurance fraud annually. Let's assume that the global scale of insurance fraud could be around 20 billion pounds. Now, most of those frauds are done with the help or direct involvement of independent insurance brokers and agents who usually obtain their licenses from a central bank or a similar state-regulated organization. On top of the losses, insurance companies are investing hundreds of millions into fraud prevention and legislators invent new obscure ‘consumer protection’ rules. Yet  the preventive effects of the latter are questionable and the cost of insurance only rises.”However, Vranova points out that most investors do not realise their proper position and level of vulnerability once signed-up for any such investment packages.“Unfortunately people don't realize that it's not their funds when they transfer their Bitcoin (or money) to someone else's account: ‘It is only a promise to hold and eventually grow the sum for me.”In conclusion, Vranova says that the good news for Bitcoin is that it may be actually less prone to fraud than the US dollar or Euro. As Bitcoin is an open ledger and an open community, it is relatively easier to get feedback from the community, do research on the companies, their teams and investment parameters before making decisions.The Founder of Cryptopay, a UK Bitcoin payment gateway, George Basiladze, says that the only thing which is responsible for online scams is people’s greed.According to Basiladze, most of the scam projects and Ponzi schemes are so easy to expose as long as greed does not get in the way. He also points out that anybody willing to undertake any form of investment must seek to understand the specific market and exercise patience.He says:“Investors need to be reasonable and seek to understand the world of capital markets, and get educated. Another thing investors should know is that you cannot get rich quickly or get 7000% ROI without being scammed. Everything needs time and patience.”Aleksandar Matanovic of EC District Financial Services also tells Cointelegraph that a lot of people have fallen victim to online scams due to their attraction to various testimonials of other investors who may have truly earned a lot of money within the crypto industry.He says:“There are lot of true stories about people who have earned huge amounts of money with Bitcoin, whether it is through mining, trading or something else. Because of those stories, people know it is possible to make fast profits with Bitcoin and so they are more susceptible to scammers and their schemes which promise big returns on investments.”However, Matanovic advises any investor to be logical when seeking genuine ventures. He also identifies greed as the factor which can cloud logical reasoning when it comes to investments:“Investors should think clearly and not let their logic be pushed aside by their greed. I mean, there are schemes offering 10% daily; can someone actually believe that it is not a scam unless he/she is totally blinded by greed? People need to know that every single chance to make profits comes with a certain risk. And, of course, they should invest only what they are ready to lose, because if they are totally new to Bitcoin and eager to invest ASAP without dedicating some time to research, they will probably lose.” ",[]
Major Bitcoin Miner Disappears Along with Millions of Dollars Worth of Bitcoin,Olusegun Ogundeji,2016-06-27 10:15:00,1674,1997,"Usual website activities of a major Bitcoin miner Hashocean are nowhere to be found, fuelling suggestions that the cloudminer is a scam.According to ‘Is It Down Right Now’ which monitors the status of favorite web sites and checks whether they are down or not using the test tool below, as well as graphs and users’ comments, Hashocean has been down for more than five days.A visit to the Hashocean website shows the ‘403 Forbidden cloudflare-nginx’ message. “Hashocean.com is PARKED,” ""Is It Down Right Now"" says. “The website is either expired or listed for sale...” As at the time of this publication, it says the Hashocean site has been down for about 5 days 19 hours. Its youtube and Facebook pages have also been removed.Now, based on the assumption that the miner has disappeared with the money invested by its subscribers - reportedly about 700,000 of them, several comments have trailed Hashocean’s sudden disappearance.OrionOverwatch writes on Reddit:“I calculated how much money they ran away with. They pay around 1900 Bitcoins every single day during the last couple of days and they received about 2200 a day, except from yesterday which is probably why they shut down. Looking at the different dates and making a rough estimation it's pretty easy to find out they earned on average about 140 Bitcoins a day during roughly 20 months which would be a cool 50M$. (it's probably around 35M$ and 65M$). They will probably sell a small number of the Bitcoins every day which will obviously make the price per Bitcoin decrease significantly during the next days, months or even years. Kind of a pessimistic opinion but a realistic one.”Spoonfednonsense says:“Yeah I lost 1.75 Bitcoin myself. Saw it coming with the Halving coming up. I even knew it was a Ponzi scheme (a fool and his money are easily parted, is the lesson I learned from this one.”Another posted a link to the report on the site’s domain registration details which cite Richard Maisano as its owner and seeking to get the issue reported to the relevant authorities.However, despite the gloomy view to it, some are still hopeful.Johann Steynberg in his comment on www.isitdownrightnow.com, writes in response to another comment which suggested through a link that the miner will be back soon:“Thank you. Let's wait and see what happens when the new payment run is due. Only then will we be able to know for sure.”",26
Fear and Panic As Online Trading Company Loses Trust of Investors,Iyke Aru,2016-06-07 11:30:00,371,50,"The inability to access funds and a sudden change of contract terms and conditions without notice has thrown investors within the online trading company, OneFxZone into panic mode.Originally known as OneFxZone, ‘One International Limited’ is a company that claims to trade in Foreign Exchange and welcomed investors with a promise of various attractive returns on investments. OneFxZone accepted deposits in Bitcoins, Paypal, Bank wire, etc.Launched in November 2015, OneFxZone boasted of very efficient and easy operational procedures until about five months after existence.“I signed up on OneFxZone in November 2105, sponsored by Kyle Gibson. My initial investment was $25 only and at the time of investment expiry I had earned up to $400. That was when the programme was doing well,” says Hameed Olaniyi Ogundipe.Another investor from Nigeria who chose to remain anonymous tells Cointelegraph that he was signed up by the same Kyle Gibson in March 2016. According to him, at the point of entry, every detail of the contract was clear and straightforward until the beginning of May 2016, when adjustments began to take place without prior notification.Originally known as a forex trading company that allowed investors to cash out their earnings on a weekly basis, five months after existence, OneFxZone announced its expansion and introduction of new investment packages with claims to be trading in gold as a commodity and an improved additional investment opportunity.Less than two hours before the opening of the cashout period on Monday May 9, 2016, investors were greeted with the news that they could not make withdrawals anymore until the 5th of the coming month as the rules had changed from weekly to monthly withdrawal dates.“After the change in system without adequate notice, I became uncomfortable with the scheme. I went a step further to research, only to discover that certain online profiles within the company were pseudo identities. Fake names of people who never existed. At this point it dawned on me that I had been scammed!” says an investor.Latest among the disheartening news to investors is the development that no further withdrawals can be performed unless an individual’s account is ‘verified’, a process which involves the submission of certain required documents and a will, unlike what is required elsewhere, a process which takes three months.Investors who spoke to Cointelegraph complained about the impromptu nature of these developments, and the timing of such announcements which happens to coincide with the coming cashout period.Ogundipe expressed his lack of trust for the system at the moment. He says:“At the beginning of the program, I was given full support by the founder and admin, I was given the assurance that the whole plan was long term. That for me was the catch.Having had several experiences, I had to be smart. Hence my little deposit. But at this point, it is clear that most investors will not have their accounts verified until the expiration of their contracts. Obviously, something is not right.”Several complaints from participants in a Facebook chat group who have all invested into the scheme have been ignored by the usually prompt ‘live support’ chats on the company’s website, and there have been non-approval of uploaded verification documents and multiple non-access pop-ups on the website.Maybe this is a well executed plan to defraud unsuspecting investors, or maybe it is just a phase within the company’s development. One thing is certain - affected investors’ worries that all their invested wealth is gone with the wind are not unwarranted.",[]
"Beware: 4 Typical Bitcoin Scams in Mining, Investment, Wallets, Exchange",Shivdeep Dhaliwal,2016-03-24 09:33:00,9092,190,"We have collected four typical scams to remind you that Bitcoin is just cash, and you should take care to use it as real money: Carefully. Most frauds and scams don’t happen because of the technology involved but rather due to the underlying greed and callousness on the part of the users.There is something about Bitcoin that attracts all kinds of scam artists and frauds. It even has the potential to turn secret service agents into thieves.In December 2015 ex-Secret Service agent Shaun Bridges was sentenced to nearly six years in prison after pleading guilty to money laundering and obstruction charges in connection with the theft of more than $820,000 in bitcoin from accounts connected to the Silk Road. Now the US government believes that he may have been involved with additional thefts from the now-defunct online dark market:""...the US had recently become aware of additional thefts of bitcoins from Secret Service accounts, the facts of which led the government to believe that Bridges, working with others, was also involved in these thefts.""US District Judge Richard Seeborg, who presided over the case, remarked that from what he could see, this crime had been motivated by greed. “No departure or variance is warranted in this case,” he said.Why Bitcoin attracts thugs? Very simply because of its very nature. You can remain anonymous while conducting Bitcoin transactions and there is no chargeback mechanism built into the virtual currency. We would like to emphasize here the word currency because it is akin to paying with cash. Reversals and chargebacks are more talk of the plastic money domain.A study done by researchers at the Southern Methodist University in Texas, USA in January 2015 reveals a great deal about common Bitcoin scams and how people fall victim to them. The research was conducted by Marie Vasek and Tyler Moore and is titled There's No Free Lunch, Even Using Bitcoin: Tracking the Popularity and Profits of Virtual Currency Scams.  The research revealed 41 scams that occurred between 2011 and 2014 in which 13,000 victims fell prey to fraudulent websites. The amount of money lost in this period was nearly a conservative USD 11 million.We looked at the findings of Marie Vasek and Tyler Moore and here are their key findings. The common element among all these scams though is greed and naivety on the part of the users:1. Bitcoin Investment Programs: If it is too good to be true it probably is not goes the old adage and it is as true today as it was in the past. When people are promised higher yields on their deposits, they are often swayed by greed.You should be wary of wallets that offer returns if you keep money in them or if some investment program gives you way more returns than the prevalent market rates.2. Bitcoin Mining Scams: A lot of mining operations are alleged to be scams but to narrow down the definition mining scams can be described as operations, which take a fee to mine Bitcoin on your behalf but never deliver. Cloud mining particularly has been in the eye of the storm. Researchers Moore and Vasek:“Active Mining and Ice Drill are operations that raised money to purportedly make ASICs and share the profits but never delivered. AsicMiningEquipment.com and Dragon-Miner.com are fraudulent mining e-commerce websites.”3. Bitcoin Wallet scams: Getting pickpocketed sucks but having your money vaporize under your very nose is brutal. The usual modus operandi of scam wallets is that the victim deposits Bitcoin into such a wallet and when it reaches a certain threshold; the money is transferred to the scamster’s wallet. In its analyses of fraudulent Bitcoin wallets, the report states that:“We were able to analyze three of these services (Onion Wallet, Easy Coin, and Bitcoinwallet.in), in which all transfers from the victims were ultimately delivered to the same address held by the scammer. These particular scams advertise themselves as offering a mixing service that enhances transaction anonymity for customers. In fact, all three services appear to be operated by the same scammer, because the siphoning transfers all go directly to the same Bitcoin address.”4. Bitcoin Exchange Scams: Exchanges are the point of entry into the Bitcoin universe and many victims of scams are attracted to lower exchange rates, promises of anonymity or offerings such as PayPal or Credit Card processing that other exchanges may not offer.Once the victim deposits payment for buying Bitcoin, they never actually receive their cryptocurrency leaving them high and dry. Most fraudulent exchanges seem to have a short life span.",7
Next BTC Scam Wants You: What Makes People Fall Into Financial Traps,Julián Bordet,2016-03-14 17:28:00,810,44,"As the number of new Bitcoin users and transactions grow, the number and sophistication of scams in the community continues to reach new heights. Why are so many people getting scammed over and over again?There are a lot of reasons that explain the why people hand their money to total strangers so easily. One of the prime facts that come into play is that a lot of bitcoin users have joined the network in the post-thousand dollars per bitcoin era. These consumers feel that they have missed the train and desperately want to make up for it, which puts considerable psychological pressure to want to believe too-good-to-be-true stories.Think of the average Joe that has tens of thousands of dollars of student loan debt following them around, month after month deeper in the red, shocked to find out that his newly acquired college degree only lets him earn a couple of dollars above minimum wage.These people are desperately wishing for a miracle, and when they find such an innovative and disruptive technology as bitcoin, considered by many to be able to replace the most established and powerful corporations in the word, they are no different than a dehydrated man in the middle of the Sahara desert who just saw an oasis on the horizon.Now we have people wishing for a miracle on an everyday basis. They suddenly find themselves with cutting-edge technology on their hands, technology that, although they do not entirely understand it, makes them feel that they are in charge of their own lives once again after so long. At first they feel like bank’s doomsday bringers, but after a while, the emotion gets cold and the old problems are still there. This is the critical moment when lots of people hear about High Yield Investment Programs, or HYIP for short, for the very first time.Scammers come in lots of shapes and sizes, and so do their operations, but they all have one thing in common: they are very good social engineers. These guys know exactly the right buttons to press to get their unaware victim’s attention, as well as how eager their innocent counterpart is to find a magical solution to their financial distress.Scammers and their HYIPs fool people into thinking that only by pressing a couple of buttons on a keyboard, all their problems will be solved. They offer them redemption. Not everyone who falls into the hands of a scammer are over-indebted people though. There are also those who fancy themselves to be Hollywood-like hedge fund managers.This particular type of victim usually thinks they are smarter than the rest but for some unknown reason life is not rewarding them as it should. So, when they find out that some shady website offers 50% monthly returns on their ‘investment’, after playing for a couple of minutes with their smartphone’s calculator app, they hand out their money no questions asked.So, after the inevitable takes place and tears begin to fall, people start wondering why this happened to them. The answer most of the time is that they were using a technology that they didn’t fully understand and let themselves be fooled by their eagerness for last minute salvation. If bitcoin ever taught me anything, it is the power of the word ‘trust’.At the end of the day, the victim learns an important maxim: there are no magical solutions to problems, be they financial or otherwise. If you have fallen into one of these deceptions, don’t get depressed over it, absorb the experience and move on with your head held high, knowing that you are wiser than before. After all, you now have the means and the knowledge to be your own bank.",[]
Bitstamp Uncovers Bitcoin-Stealing Chrome Extension,Charlie McCombie,2016-03-14 11:22:00,534,5,"The Slovenia-based Bitcoin trading platform, Bitstamp, revealed in a Tweet that it had uncovered a Google Chrome extension that replaced all QR codes. It linked to Bitcoin addresses and then linked to the thief’s wallet. This is not the first time criminals have attempted to steal Bitcoin via Google Chrome extensions.On March 11, Bitstamp released a Tweet that said it had discovered a Google Chrome extension called ‘BitcoinWisdom Ads Remover’ that “will try to steal your Bitcoin”:Be careful! We have uncovered a Chrome extension called BitcoinWisdom Ads Remover that will try to steal your #bitcoin.Members of the Bitcoin community were quick to investigate the claims, with Devon Weller, a cryptocurrency web app developer saying:“Confirmed. I looked at the source code. It replaces QR code images on bitcoin exchanges with its own addresses.”Further investigation by Reddit user, /u/methamphetaminic, revealed some interesting developments. They discovered that the browser extension had about 200 bitcoin addresses hard-coded into it, but only 3 transactions had made their way to the scammer’s wallet; payments of 0.00433517 BTC from 1FosyhE1WvDxTBjA6e4a8N6yJ5MkZgDgUZ, 0.00186735 BTC from 1ExHFeLBKxmqtfi5mEd6ov6a5vBaBuHCYH, and of 0.07805963 BTC from 1MaUiURfN7pytCTC1FnHRSZ13N6AzXVszp, all of which took place in July 2015.The Redditor surmised that these were probably test payments by the scammer to ensure his payment system worked. They also suggested that, given the lack of transactions going into the scammer’s wallet, the scamming operation can’t have been all that successful or profitable.Interestingly, something not seen in previous Google Chrome extension scams, the extension didn’t simply try to replace all addresses and QR codes with the the scammer’s, but instead only targeted addressed on sites including bitstamp.net, btc-e.com, and hasnest.com. Some have suggested that the scammer probably had some personal grievance against one or more of these sites, and such wanted petty revenge. This Redditor in particular theorised that it could be “somebody who hates ads on bitcoinwisdom, [or] maybe a miner who also deals with bitstamp and btc-e in particular.”This is far from the first time that scammers have tried to steal users’ Bitcoin using Google Chrome extensions. In April 2014, an extension entitled ‘Cryptsy Dogecoin Live Ticker’ released an update to its semi-popular chrome extension that had code in in that rerouted Bitcoin transactions again to the scammer’s wallet instead of the intended recipient. The extension, developed by TheTrollBox, was quickly removed from the Chrome Store by Google, along with the developer’s 21 other extensions, which were all various variations on the ‘Live Ticker’ name.",[]
NextBank Drops Crowdfunding Campaign After Receiving $1.4 Million From Private Investors,Marco E. G. Maltese,2015-12-16 17:46:00,294,0,"Crowdfunding for NextBank has been dropped after the team received 1.4 Million USD from unknown private investors. With the additional 0.95 Million USD received by private VC, NextBank totaled 2.35 Million USD.BitcoinPRBuzz informed Cointelegraph with an email of the recent action from the NextBank team. Their article states that:“NextBank has now stopped the public crowdfunding process. NextBank is thankful to all private investors, and those who have already invested small amounts will still be minority shareholders or may choose to have their investment refunded in full. NextBank will continue funding through venture capitalist avenues in order to ease the concerns of the public.All those that have contributed small amounts to the $2.35 million fund will be minority shareholders or will be refunded in full. The vast majority of the fund comes from private angel investors.”Cointelegraph covered the NextBank entrance on the scene exactly one month ago, by expressing perplexity regarding the way people behind this project are working, especially regarding the quantity of funds to start such a large project, that would offer essentially any service you can think of from a bank.From the PRBuzz article it seems that the soon to be bank didn’t drop any of the services originally planned.The PRBuzz article also states that NextBank team has completed the “innovative software”, however, it’s also worth noting that after one month since its appearance, the NextBank website is still only showing a front page without a news section, an about section, or even a FAQ section, and after trying to register, the author of this article didn’t receive an email response.The project’s Facebook page gives some news… but not about NextBank: just about anything else, but NextBank is completely invisible in what could be the only place with some update. They didn’t even update about the starting of the crowdfunding campaign and the halting of it.This massive project only gives a single “PR” person as a contact: Simon Peltin, but it is impossible to find any trace of this person on the internet, Skype as well doesn’t show any result.Dim Voloshinsky is cited on PRNewswire as the founder of the project. He seems to be a ghost as well, and even the mentioned future CEO of NextBank, former CEO of imaginary Vanuatu Private Bank, seems to be an imaginary person as well.This whole thing still looks terribly hollow, and it’s the opinion of our consultant Simon Dixon, CEO BnkToTheFuture, that these people, even if the project isn’t a complete scam, could already be facing serious legal problems:""Starting a bank is one of the hardest regulatory challenges one can take. To get a banking license you will need an incredible understanding of financial regulations and banking experience to pass the regulators and central banks licensing requirements. So far I can see three problems already that would get them in trouble with regulators. Firstly, they are raising finance illegally through their website inviting any investor to invest without using an exemption, filing a public offering or using a platform registered with a regulator like BnkToTheFuture.com. This is in breach of most financial securities acts.Secondly, the name 'Bank' can only be used once they have secured a banking license. Add this to the fact that we don't know who is behind it.It looks like either a team of inexperienced founders with little regards for the law,that won't get them their license or simply a group of anonymous people tricking investors out of their money. I hope I am wrong, I want to see new banks challenge the status quo, but nothing adds up here. I welcome comment from the team telling me otherwise.""Cointelegraph has sent an email to [email protected]/* <![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=""currentScript""in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(""script""),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(""data-cfhash""))return t[e]}();if(t&&t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(""data-cfemail"");if(a){for(e="""",r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */, that should be read by Simon Peltin, PR, NextBank Formation Company, the only possible contact with the company, but at the moment of publication no answer arrived.Cointelegraph will be glad to publish their answer to our doubts in case this should come.Until that moment, watch your financial steps.We hope that you liked this article.

"NextBank: Scams, Foolishness or Reality?",Marco E. G. Maltese,2015-11-17 17:03:00,410,0,"It’s been around for some time now: a new international bank is coming to town, named NextBank. It looks and feels like either a miracle or a scam. That’s why Cointelegraph conducted a survey with experts from the banking industry to investigate the truth.A short introduction to the project, NextBank. They promote themselves as they will allow you to store value in 135 FIAT currencies, precious metals and, of course, cryptocurrencies. NextBank will offer a wide variety of services like international debit cards and escrow service, in reality, it claims that it will offer ALL the services you can think a bank can offer. On top of this, it will also have a help desk in 50 and more languages.NextBank, based in Vanuatu, an archipelago nation east of Australia, is planning to obtain the necessary operation licenses in the beginning of the next year.The NextBank Foundation Company is registered in Vanuatu with company registration number 300104. That is what we know from the press-release. It’s a beautiful tale to read.We contacted Luca Dordolo, one of the first Bitcoin entrepreneurs in Italy and long time politician, bitcoin consultant for Kryptomith Ltd, who had a direct contact with the organization.He was pretty excited about this new, fully featured bank coming onto the market:“I firstly knew about NextBank a couple of weeks ago and considered the project to be really amazing. I read an article at first, then I connected with their website and finally I decided to contact their press center. It is very strange that a project that claims to give services in 50 different languages have their press center only in english, this was at first suspicious to me.”He then dug deeper into the available information and options on the website, only to uncover that the whole project looked inconsistent.“I was thinking to invest a few thousand Euro on it, but soon realized there was no real consistence in that project.No software, no details on how they want to open and start, no bank licenses (they say they will apply for a Vanuatu license in Q1 of next year). At last only one person, Simon Peltin, very kind and polite, got back to me but was not exhaustive enough in his replies.Peltin replied their main shareholder is from Austria and that we could arrange a meeting only in the future (but we are really only few hours by car from Wien).”After gathering more info, and landing on a Reddit thread Luca realized that there are only two options: “it’s only a scam or, in the best case, a beautiful pipe dream of a youngster with no financial experience”.Luca then informed Peltin about the thread and received a lapidary answer stating that it is up to him to buy shares or not, and that it’s up to their managers to arrange any kind of meetings and discuss any kind of cooperation, also giving a link to their answer on Reddit.Mr. Dordolo abandoned the newborn bank bitterly, stating that “this project will take too long to stand up alone. It's a pity... probably it is not yet time to move big whales to invest in such an ambitious, innovative financial project.”To get a clearer picture of the situation, we also contacted another person, Simon Dixon, CEO of BnkToTheFuture & Fund Manager at Bitcoin Capital, he’s working since a long time in the financial industry. We asked what he thinks about the NextBank project.After reading the PR release, he answered:“I do not know anything about this company, but if I were sent a proposition to invest in a new bank to launch in 7 different countries in 2016, I would start by asking to see 7 different banking licenses just to start my due diligence process. You have to have a banking license in each country you wish to operate in, just to use the word ‘bank’ in your name or you have to have permission from the government and regulator. If they did not produce them then I would end my due diligence there and move on.”We asked Simon if he thought that somebody without at least ten years of experience in banking could successfully launch a thing like NextBank, he answered:“New banking requires new thinking and old bankers create old banks, but to understand how to create a new bank you will need an exceptional understanding of what is wrong with the old banks and probably have to have worked at one to gain such experience. Saying that the definition of what is considered a bank is getting more and more grey as more FinTech companies chip away at what used to be known as a bank. If you are talking about basic loans and deposits then a very good understanding of the risk model underpinning the bank would be required. Are they operating fractional reserve or full reserve banking? If full reserve, how do they make money? If fractional reserve how do they protect depositors money?”Finally, he also told us that the funds expected to be raised look far too small to what would be necessary for a project of such scale:“To launch a bank in one country I would want $20m just to submit the application to the regulators and another $50m to meet reserve requirements. If I were launching in 7 countries, multiply that number by 7.""A Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist (CAMS), Certified Fraud Examiner (CFE), and Anti-Money Laundering Certified Associate (AMLCA), student advisor at the Northeastern University College of Criminal Justice, who prefers to remain anonymous, has worked for 20 global banks and is an advocate of digital currency and access to financial services for the unbanked. He told us his opinion on the NextBank project as well:“There is no way anyone can pull this off, certainly not in the timeframe they've outlined. Financially, logistically, and operationally, this is highly improbable.From a compliance perspective, I would have expected such a large-scale, massive undertaking to have immediately named a CEO and chief compliance officer. There are way too many complex layers of regulation to work through.I'm not prepared to go on record, but I'd say this is looking like a scam.”",[]
Security Experts Advise on Fighting Cybercrime Amid Reports on Syrian Email Scam Attacks,Nina Lyon,2015-11-08 19:09:00,309,0,"Attention: Cointelegraph stongly advises NOT to fulfill any email demands coming from scammers calling themselves the Syrian Electronic Army (SEA), a division of ISIS.The Radicati Group research showed that about 84% of all email traffic in 2013 was spam. A report from Online Headquarters of Kaspersky Lab security experts securelist.com shows that in Q2 2015, the percentage of spam in email traffic was 53.4%. According to cnet.com, about 30% of Americans knowingly open spam, to which they say: ""I know I shouldn't, but I will."" It's time to say “No”.The latest report on major email scams comes from a news website stuff.co.nz, based in New Zealand. Hackers claiming to be the Syrian Electronic Army are sending emails demanding a ransom of $1,500 in Bitcoin to support ISIS' army in its war. Hackers demand to send money to a specified account within 72 hours, otherwise someone from the email recipient’s family is promised to be killed. The text of the email says:""If you refuse to pay the money all the important files from your computer will be deleted. Also, if you will go to the police after you have paid the money we will destroy you and all your family.""Emails contain personal information of the recipient, such as their phone number, IP address and date of birth. Moreover, the alleged terrorists promise to keep track of the recipient's phone calls, internet traffic, as well as keep an eye on their house.According to Scott Rees, Senior Sergeant at the local Police District Command Centre, he had received four reports of the email on Saturday morning alone. Police is working on identifying the perpetrators, and also to find out how did the scammers obtain people's personal information.""It makes me really angry that they'll be emailing people less cynical than I am and probably scaring them out of their wits,"" said a woman, who reported about the threat email. She used to live in Auckland but moved to Australia in 2012.Igor Mikitasov, who lives in Bangkok but has his family stay in New Zealand, posted on Facebook that he received a similar email demanding to send money to help SEA fight the Russian Army.“The e-mail shows specific personal information about me and my family members, who are living 10 000 km away from Bangkok. They not only have electronic personal data, but also things that could only be discovered by physical surveillance.”Igor asked if there are network security experts out there, who can locate these scammers, find out who they are and fight back for a bounty.  While Bitcoin is a digital currency that provides a certain level of anonymity, some people try to misuse it in different kinds of scams. Amid these worrying reports, one has to be able to counter the threat of financial cybercrime. Fortunately, modern security specialists and law enforcement agencies have developed specific solutions to fight back. Cointelegraph has asked several IT and security specialists to share their opinion on the case.Michal Wendrowski, an internet security specialist and the founder of Rublon said to Cointelegraph:“It is not clear who the author of those emails really is. Today's state of the world, with the current refugee crisis and most people's inability to judge IT security risks, makes a great combination for such a criminal initiative. […] This case actually reminds me of CryptoLocker and CryptoWall, malware that encrypts data on your hard drive and asks you to pay in order to decrypt it. Last month, Joseph Bonavolonta, Assistant Special Agent in Charge of the Cyber and Counterintelligence Program in the FBI's Boston office, said that the FBI often advises people to just pay the ransom. According to one study, up to 40% of victims of CryptoLocker  paid to unlock their files. I doubt that the this Syrian Electronic Army email will be as effective because there is no proof of real danger (unlike with CryptoWall, where you can't access your data anymore). A few percent might pay though. People will be looking for advice. The media will play an important role here educating those who received these threats.”Michal Wendrowski believes it is a scam. His advice is to ignore these messages and report them to the Police.Another “NetSec Genius” calling himself “Hacker sp00f3d” also commented on this:“Hard to say, how to fight against it. It's one thing to deal with the attack, and another thing to deal with the phenomenon. There are two possible ways of fighting against it: technological and administrative. US has an Echelon system. Russia have systems SORM1 or SORM2. These systems, when used properly, can help to catch such villains.”Alena Vranova, Co-Founder & Director at SatoshiLabs commented:“To me it looks like someone trying to scam people through a database of stolen records. I would not react to that the same way I don't answer to African bank transfer requests. […]More importantly this may be yet another event resulting from companies' and governments' inability to protect private data online. The way we approach and maintain sensitive data has to change. ""Don't collect what you can't protect"" should be a basic security mantra for most companies. Of course, legislation doesn't help much here, on the contrary, we see attempts of regulators to enforce more data collection and even waiving liability in case of data breaches.”Usually, security specialists and agencies advise users and companies to never pay the ransoms that are demanded in such emails. Today, Acting National Crime Manager Paul Berry said that the NZ police are investigating the case of SEA emails. Users who do feel at risk are advised to contact their nearest Police station. Berry also commented:""Other recipients may not feel as threatened but may still wish to assist with the investigation in order to prevent it from spreading further.""",[]
Fool Me Once … Top 5 Bitcoin-Related Scams for 2015,William Suberg,2015-10-30 18:26:00,870,25,"Cointelegraph is always keen to bring to readers’ attention anything suspicious in crypto-industry and beyond.We’ve been surprised by the sheer audacity of some rogue players still playing a major role in today’s market, so read on for our pick of the very worst.Don’t forget to leave your opinion beneath the article – debate helps pressure bad actors into explaining their actions and showing their true colors.Cointelegraph previously ran an expose about OneCoin, the global ponzi scheme seemingly able to fool everyone from the Economist to the hoards of trolls who took to our comments section following publication of the article.Far from dying out, OneCoin continues to spread, despite the comprehensive list of discrepancies – some of which are even shocking in their carelessness – which are freely available for discovery in its own marketing material.Stunts such as calling a paid advertisement in Forbes Bulgaria as a genuine interview and mismatching information about the founders and their qualifications are complimented by bizarre charity spin-off websites and some of the most incomprehensible English usage imaginable.Add to that repeated claims of partnerships in which the “partners” deny any knowledge of OneCoin, and a user agreement seemingly copied from dating websites, and it becomes clear that legitimacy is not on the operation’s list of priorities.Rather than throwing up your hands in horror, Cointelegraph recommends that readers join the debate in our expose’s comments section to see professional trolling in action and examine a constant reminder that fraudsters know no boundaries.MMM Global describes itself as a “mutual-aid program” consisting of a “community” in which donations are exchanged on a P2P basis.MMM’s website, mmmglobal.biz, contains reams of information describing how the scheme functions, none of which appears to make verifiable logical sense. (It is, however, mercifully written in better English than that of its likely inspiration, OneCoin.)The website states that MMM makes use of an internal “conventional currency unit” called the “mavro” to facilitate P2P funds transfer. The mavro, which is named after its founder Sergei Mavrodi, is said to “profoundly differ” from cryptocurrency as the latter is a “speculative tool.”“[...] It’s much easier to participate in the Community than to deal with crypto-currencies. You won’t need any stock knowledge to open a bid, to pay fees to stockbrokers, etc. Everything is as simple as possible: enter the personal office (PO), indicate what amount you’d like to grant or accept as a gift. Both a recipient and a sender of help are chosen automatically, you transfer and get funds – and that’s it!”MMM takes pains to point out that it is not a business. Explanations vary from matter-of-fact on its website:“MMM isn’t a company, organization or any kind of business. Being not as such, MMM Community doesn’t, accordingly: possess a personal account, render any services and enter into legal relations with anybody.”...to bizarrely agitated on its social media pages:“WE cannot SCAM, because we are :NOT a BUSINESS ...NOT a COMPANY.....NOT a HYIP...We are an INTERNATIONAL social-financial COMMUNITY based on both ONLINE and OFFLINE connection worldwide. We HELP each other to reach a BETTER financial condition. TODAY you HELP, IN 30-DAYS you will be allowed to GET HELP with 30% ADDITION from your amount of HELP...Our membership is FREE for everyone in”Nonetheless, MMM gives us all a reason to trust, even addressing the taboo issue of “Could I lose my money?”“Since MMM is neither the bank nor the investment project, then, strictly speaking, losing your donated funds is impossible...,” they explain. “But it is possible that you have given help worth more than received. Therefore, in the interests of psychological safety, it is necessary to give help in the amount that you are willing to give gratuitously.”BTCC CEO Bobby Lee was unconvinced, urging consumers to stay away.Cointelegraph similarly recommends steering well clear of MMM Global as a more reliable guarantee of readers’ “psychological safety.”NextBank has received a warm reception in the Bitcoin media, with several well-known publications running feature material on the “Next BIG thing.”The digging for dirt was completed thanks to an excellent expose by Dinbits, which uncovered many of the underlying scam qualities that also surfaced during Cointelegraph’s OneCoin investigation.The “bank” intends to corner the Bitcoin-friendly bank market by operating worldwide in 50 languages – all with a US$25 million dollar investment. This, Dinbits points out, is ostensibly impossible to pull off.Technicalities are where NextBank slips up. Its website was only registered October 20, making the entire operation 9 days old operating legitimately. This perhaps might explain why its website security is sorely lacking, featuring only a username and password for user accounts with none of the 3-Factor authentication mentioned in the marketing literature.This lack of security alone for Cointelegraph is the deciding factor in determining our advice to stay away from NextBank, despite the many more believable – even well-written – promises it makes all over the internet compared to the other operations mentioned in this list.Whenever a player appears offering BTC at a significantly more “advantageous” rate than the market rate, everyone should get suspicious. Yet, those who begin to read the reasoning behind such offers still regularly buy into the sales pitch and come unstuck in the process. Why?In the case of the latest scheme from the shapeshifting team at BTC Flap, it would appear to come down to a combination of an unassuming press release and an eerily straightforward trading platform. Never mind the fact that the language used on the supposedly USA-based website is barely comprehensible English – those looking to make a quick profit on investment eat with their eyes.User experiences have surfaced online accusing Miners Center of funding transactions with hacked PayPal account balances.This allegedly Estonia-based yet now 100% Russian language (check the Soviet Union domain name) outfit advertising “mining done right” does little to cover up the jokiness of its USP: mining Dogecoin.Cointelegraph previously ran an expose on Cointellect.com, a domain still advertised on Cointellect.su but no longer actually working. The lack of transparency and presence of malware in the company’s product rang alarm bells, and the reincarnation of Cointellect in a reduced form with markedly less functionality should only serve to make the community even more wary.As ZeroHedge points out quoting P. Diddy’s rather apathetic comments at the recent Revolt Music Conference, international governments are hardly any better, really.Diddy was the figurehead of the “Vote or Die” movement, encouraging young people to engage in democratic voting process. It would, appear, however, that he has become somewhat jaded – to the extent that he considered it necessary call “Scam!” on the whole sordid phenomenon. He stepped down from the position earlier this week.“See the things [sic] that’s tricky about politics is there’s so much bullshit with it. We started Vote or Die and […] and from the community we’re in, we’re not with hearing too much of the bullshit [...] the whole shit is a scam.”Cointelegraph advises everyone to stay away from the schemes listed above as well as from any entity offering bitcoin exchange services below market price.",[]
Multi-Million Dollar ‘Grandmother Scam’ Using Bitcoin Ends in Miami,Evander Smart,2015-10-26 16:47:49,408,0,"A Canadian man who devised an elaborate scheme to defraud elderly U.S. citizens while using monetary transmitters like Western Union and Bitcoin has been caught. Stephan Moskwyn is looking at up to thirty years in federal prison for money laundering and related crimes performed in Southern Florida.The basic premise was simple: Call the large elderly population in Florida from a Canadian call center and purport to be a grandchild or other relative in need of money, due to a legal issue or accident. The callers would have them send the funds in the form of pre-paid debit cards, or money orders via Western Union, which would later be cashed in foreign markets like Chile and the Dominican Republic.Then “virtual money orders” were converted to Bitcoin by Moskwyn. He had bought pre-paid debit cards in Miami-Dade and Broward counties to execute the scams, which is when he met with witnesses who were working for federal law enforcement, according to documents submitted to the court. Those who were scammed would even go the extra mile to help, sending more funds than requested multiple times, according to federal investigators.U.S. Attorney Wifredo Ferrer said:""This scam exploited the kindness and trust of elderly American citizens by convincing them that loved ones were in trouble and needed money […] Criminals who engage in these scams must know that they are not safe from prosecution, merely because they operate from foreign countries or use virtual currencies.""Moskwyn spent times traveling between Miami, Chile and the Dominican Republic, buying more pre-paid debit cards when he was in Miami. He was finally arrested by the authorities last week on one of his flights between Chile and the Dominican Republic, during a layover in Miami. Moskwyn will be arraigned in the coming days.",[]
$32 Million Cryptocurrency Scam Ceased by the SEC,Joseph Young,2015-10-04 16:44:38,425,0,"The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has ceased a US$32 million cryptocurrency investment scam created by Steve Chen, who misled hundreds of investors to raise millions of dollars, by claiming that the investment firm US Fine Investment Arts, Inc. (USFIA) was a subsidiary of US China Consultation Association, a joint venture between the United States and Chinese governments.The USFIA (Jason Chen) guaranteed its investors a 64x payout in Gemcoins, in exchange for their investment in the company. Chen personally claimed that USFIA owned large amber mines in the Dominican Republic and Argentina, and that USFIA was set to undergo an initial public offering in the near future.Foreign investors took interest in the IPO of USFIA and Chen’s claims that all investors would be entitled to receive pre-IPO shares in USFIA that would increase in value once the company becomes listed on the public stock market.Investors were promised a highly profitable payout in Gemcoin, a cryptocurrency created by USFIA as part of the scheme. On its website, USFIA stated that Gemcoin is backed by US$50 billion in assets and has partnered with ApplePay to roll out 2,500 ATMs throughout the United States.“Gemcoin's value is backed by parent company AFG’s 10 Precious Gem mines and Gemcoin are stable as it is backed by its equivalent in precious stones. USFIA has agreements with ApplePay - 2,500 ATM's ready for nationwide distribution for use with our Global VISA Debit Card and joining a ATM network along side Bitcoin,” announced USFIA.Furthermore, Chen and others from USFIA hosted multiple presentations and talks to convince its investors that the company:The US$32 million raised from the Gemcoin scam was almost immediately wired to Chen’s personal accounts in China, which are now frozen due to the complaints of the US SEC.

Police Crackdown on €50 Million Spanish Virtual Currency Ponzi Scheme 'Unete',Diana Ngo,2015-07-16 14:38:31,373,0,"Spanish national police have arrested 20 people involved in massive Ponzi scheme, Unetenet. The investment company has reportedly swindled 50,000 investors out of €50 million, according to major national news outlet El Pais.Unetenet, an alleged alternative investment firm, promised affiliates annual ROIs of over 350% paid in the company's homemade virtual currency, 'unete.'""I have 8,000 unetes that I cannot convert to euros,"" Carmen Ramírez, a pensioner from Córdoba and a victim of the scheme, told the news service.Alain Tamellina, a businessman who bought €18,000 worth of unete, said:""José Manuel told us he was setting up a unete bank, and we believed him.""In April 2014, the company stopped paying its investors, after Latvian bank Rietumu froze the account of Unetenet founder José Manuel Ramírez Marco, as part of an investigation into money laundering.Spain's National Court blocked his Latvian bank account containing €5 million and is further retaining US$22 million belonging to the company.Union Business Online LTD, the company operating Unetenet, is registered in the tax haven of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines where investors' funds would then be transferred to Malta, Romania and Latvia.""His businesses handled up to €70 million,"" Adrián Trigo, a former business partner of Ramírez, told the media outlet. Trigo further said that at one point, up to €1.5 million was being transferred into Ramírez’s accounts every day.According to another former collaborator, Ramírez got the unete idea from Sergey Mavrodi, a Russian criminal who founded the MMM series of pyramid schemes.In 2007, Mavrodi was found guilty in a Russian court of defrauding 10,000 investors out of 110 million rubles (US$4.3 million). The Russian court sentenced him to four and a half years in a penal colony, in addition to a 10,000 ruble (US$390) fine.In 2011, Mavrodi launched two other pyramid schemes called MMM-2011 and MMM India. MMM-2011 was able to function openly as Ponzi schemes as financial pyramids are not illegal under Russian law.""José Manuel was obsessed with Mavrodi,"" the former collaborator said, adding that his former employer was constantly trying to work out how to set up a bank, an alternative financial system, and even a city to be called Unetecity.The Ponzi scheme extended to a dozen countries, according to experts. So far, more than 100 of the 6,000 Spanish victims filed the class-action lawsuit.Ramírez' name is linked to System World Investment, a firm operating under the brand name Dextraplus. Spain's Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores, a governmental agency responsible for the financial regulation of the securities markets in the country, issued a public warning on System World Investment in 2009, calling the company a ""financial scam.""Ramírez also worked for Finanzas Forex, a Panama company that operated a pyramid scheme. Founder Germán Cardona was sent to prison in March 2011 for scamming 100,000 investors with total losses amounting about €300 million.Police are still searching for Ramírez and his girlfriend, Pilar Otera. Both are located in a European country and could be arrested in the coming days, the police said on Wednesday. ",[]
Litecoin Dumped by Chinese; Dash Next (Op-Ed),Evander Smart,2015-07-13 13:21:34,456,0,"On Saturday, the Litecoin market holdings were dropped like third-period French. In much the same fashion, the ultra-secure altcoin Dash has also seen a marked rise in trading over the weekend, stoking fears of an equally precipitous decline in the coming days.As we reported on Friday, an alleged “Pump-and-Dump” scam was suspected for the Litecoin currency and its sudden meteoric rise. Advocates of the altcoins would remark that the Grexit is a factor in the sudden value spikes and has helped them, as it has bitcoin.The hard numbers do not bear this out. For no particular reason, trading in Litecoin started to ascend last Monday from a value of US$4.77 to over US$8.50 on Friday. Nothing has changed in the Grexit situation over the past week to spark market sudden demand in altcoins, and the demand is not coming from Greece but from China. See the chart below for last week’s Litecoin price history.Then, on Saturday, Litecoin buying power dropped like a light switch had suddenly cut all energy, and within hours it was approaching its Monday values once again. Looks like a textbook coordinated market dump by the players involved, the vast majority of the trading originating in China over the last week.Makes sense. Who’s really watching the markets on Saturday? You could look at the chart and say ‘That’s just a coincidence,” and that is possible, but the problem is last week rumors forecasting the event of this exact “Pump-and-Dump” strategy were rampant (If you can speak Mandarin, this video may prove very useful).Thus, this wasn’t exactly a secret. My article on Friday said a massive drop in LTC values shortly is very possible, and indicative of a set-up, and that came to pass the next day.The clincher is the chart below. Almost to the hour, look at the wild increase in buying of Dash on Saturday, July 11. You don’t have to be Sherlock Holmes to see a less-than-subtle altcoin buying strategy taking place. A group of buyers suddenly wanted Dash to gain over 30% over the weekend. Fancy that. Where was the interest in Dash before Saturday?There is a difference with how Dash is set up and how Litecoin works. The Chinese, or any buyer, do not have to dump Dash in a similar fashion. If you have 1,000 Dash coins, you can set up a Dash “Masternode” and earn more Dash coins every month. The cascading effect can generate more Masternodes as needed going forward. The Dash coins in the Masternode are off the market, increasing the price of Dash, and you will still own the coins in the Masternode to make money on as you wish, based on market conditions.Could it be dumped like Litecoin was? Absolutely, but the investors have long-term options with Dash that are not available with Litecoin.Comparing this altcoin movement to bitcoin is pointless. This is because bitcoin has moved consistently upward for one month and has seen increased buying interest in Europe, in particular, and worldwide, not just from the Chinese market. The altcoins should actually be flattered that they would be used as an investment tool on any large scale, which seems to be a first. Usually, you have to have some established market presence and interest to experience currency scams and bubbles like this. Bitcoin (Mt. Gox), Gold, US Dollars, Silver, and real estate have all be inflated and manipulated before, by various private interests. Now, factions within one of the world’s largest markets cared enough about two altcoins to manipulate them into an investment scam. Welcome to the big time!",[]
Is Cloud Mining Really a Ponzi Scheme? (Op-Ed),Walid Dib,2015-06-06 10:08:00,10269,0,"Whether Bitcoin mining is profitable is not a simple question to answer. With community discord that’s almost as hot-blooded as the block size debate, one will notice that even after delving into digital currency technicalities for months, there is just no general consensus on the profitability of cloud mining.For those who are unaware, Cloud Mining is the process of Bitcoin mining utilizing remote servers with a shared pool of processing power owned by a Cloud Mining company. It sounds extremely convenient, but cloud mining can become a bit of a messy deal given the concept’s rough start.We’ve heard it all before: companies disappear with user funds, paying out early investors once new ones join, and making a run for it weeks later, which leads the average investor from avoiding the common year-long contracts.Or the argument that Bitcoin is too volatile to start with, making the profits highly unpredictable. The investment required for personal bitcoin mining is risky on its own, so imagine that risk compounded when trusting a third party with your money.To settle this dispute, Cointelegraph spoke to parties on both sides of the bell-curve: Marshall Long, CTO of Cryptsy, and Alex Gromov of Hashflare. When asked about the benefits of cloud mining over normal mining, Long explained:“The reality is this. Many large scale miners, including Mintsy and FinalHash work very hard to get cheap electric rates. In fact these electricity rates can be worked down very low sometimes under US$0.02/kWh. Now the average rate for a “decent” price in the USA is around US$0.08/kWh. But because big miners can leverage their capital in a way that can convince Power Companies to give them great rates, this allows them to pass on savings AND profit to customers.”While Gromov raises another undisputable advantage: the price.“In case of a purchase the user is very limited in choice by the technical offer from the seller. As an example, let us suppose the cheapest machine that vendor offers — is a 1 TH/s miner. Even though at this moment the equipment has become much cheaper than a few years ago, you may see this option is not for everyone, especially if you are just getting started with Bitcoin.“In this case, it’s a lot easier to take advantage of cloud mining services, where you can find out what bitcoin mining is at a basic package of literally 10 GH/s equal to less than 5 dollars.”There’s no way around it: Cloud mining is going through rough days.“Many users, after having a bad experience, have lost faith in the possibility of fair mining in the cloud, and thus all new projects are now greeted with a great deal of skepticism,” adds Gromov.This, however, could be good for entrepreneurs eager to plug the leaks in the outdated cloud mining model. To keep up with a consumer base that is more aware by the second, serious companies will need to become “far more transparent and the companies that don’t will fall to the way side,” says Long.Mintsy, in an effort to protect users who are afraid of investing too much in cloud mining, have enabled them to sell user-to-user contracts on the website’s marketplace. Marshall argues that the point behind this resides in the fact that “when cloud mining companies empower their customer base utilizing new technologies everybody wins. An agile cloud mining company both has customer loyalty and the dynamics required to operate effectively in bitcoin.”Hashflare.io has a simple answer to finding out whether or not the cloud company you’re interested in contracting with is a scam:“If you draw an analogy between recent projects that have deceived their clients and closed down, you will notice that they all share several traits: short lifespan and the promise of a very high ROI, such as 200-400% per year.”This hype, which has little to do with actual mining, can be avoided if users invest instead in cloud mining companies that are also “a manufacturer of related equipment, such as: HashCoins for HashFlare, AntMiner for Hashnest, and KnC for KNC Cloud.”Mintsy sees this a little bit differently, by employing proof-of-hashrate where customers can view “the blockchain and see proof that we have the hashrate we say we have and that we are running on full reserves and not double selling hashrate.”The overall legality and regulation of Bitcoin cloud mining is still not clear, making it even more of a risky investment, but the technology behind most of the big companies listed above is interesting to say the least. While this is a very challenging time for legitimate cloud mining companies, it is very interesting to see healthy competition acting as a driving force behind the development of digital currency mining. ",8
Author of ‘Locker’ Crypto Ransomware Decrypts All Infected Files and Apologizes,Joseph Young,2015-06-03 19:15:01,272,0,"On May 30, the author of the crypto-ransomware known as Locker posted an apology on Pastebin and claimed that he “never intended to release” the malware program. According to Threatpost.com, the author says he terminated distribution as of June 2 and that he has decrypted all infected files. The author said on Pastebin:"" I am the author of the Locker ransomware and I'm very sorry about that has happened. It was never my intention to release this. I uploaded the database to mega.co.nz containing 'bitcoin address, public key, private key' as CSV. This is a dump of the complete database and most of the keys weren't even used. All distribution of new keys has been stopped.""Security firm KnowBe4 explains Locker ransomware is a “sleeper campaign” that is installed through a social engineering attack and then sits silently on computers and encrypts files upon the activation of the malware creator.Within the first few days of its original release, the malware forcibly encrypted hundreds of computers and demanded that victims pay 0.1 BTC, approximately US$22.64 at time of this writing, for a decryption key.Despite the malware creator’s attempt to elucidate his intent, KnowBe4 CEO, Stu Sjouwerman, announced:“If you build code like this, you know very well what you are doing. The fact it was built as a ‘sleeper’ shows months-long careful planning. The other point is that if he would really have genuine remorse, everyone would get refunded which does not seem to have happened. It is also not clear if current infection vectors have been turned off or not.”Security firms, including KnowBe4, claim that Locker ransomware could have been a very successful scam, and they are speculating on the motives behind why the creator would put an end to its distribution.Sjouwerman suggested that the creator most probably did not want to attract attention from law enforcement. He said:“What we can assume is that he is a talented coder but not an experienced cybercriminal, because a foul-up like this would never have happened with professional Eastern European organized cybercrime. He may have worked as a developer for one of these gangs and decided to start his own outfit, which backfired.”",[]
"One Coin, Much Scam: OneCoin Exposed as Global MLM Ponzi Scheme",William Suberg,2015-05-27 15:34:00,36560,0,"OneCoin, a purported cryptocurrency and trading venture based out of Bulgaria, is suspected to be a pyramid scheme with no verifiable evidence to back up any of its business claims. Usually people use Cloud Mining services to invest in cryptoeconomy.Evidence supplied to Cointelegraph, in addition to reviews already published elsewhere, suggests that OneCoin.eu and the One World Foundation are scam operations.The amount of evidence contributing to OneCoin’s status as a pyramid scheme is considerable. Its directors have previously been involved in other known scam operations, its resources contain no verifiable evidence for any of its business claims and documentation uploaded to support claims often conflicts with the claims themselves.In addition, the quality of hosted content, including standards of English and website construction, are noticeably poor for an alleged international operation run by native speakers.OneCoin’s Founder, Owner and Chief Operating Officer ‘Dr. Ruja Ignatova’ is the subject of a host of claims seemingly designed to demonstrate experience and business acumen. Information uploaded to OneCoin.eu states that she received degrees from the University of Oxford and Konstanz, and is the former CEO of Bulgarian private investment firm CSIF.If the resume available at OneCoin.eu is to be taken as official information, it is notable that claims made elsewhere are not replicated in the document. Ignatova’s participation in a Harvard negotiating course is only mentioned on the One World Foundation website despite a scan being present in the resume.Ignatova’s own websites state that she graduated Oxford with Magister Juris in European and Comparative Law in 2004. The websites in question are blogs from Wordpress, Blogspot and Weebly, the latter two in German stating that in 2004 Ignatova entered employment having graduated from Oxford. A scanned certificate on OneCoin.eu states she completed the program in 2009; no document from 2004 is visible.CSIF has been contacted for confirmation of Ignatova’s previous employment, but at the time of writing Cointelegraph has not received a response.Also working for OneCoin in various capacities are Sebastian Greenwood and Nigel Allan, both of whom have been involved in scam operations in the past.Greenwood previously worked with defunct pyramid scheme Unaico, whose activities were the subject of a warning from Pakistan’s Securities and Exchanges Commission. The notice cited “illegal multi-level marketing” practices and advised consumers “to refrain from investing/ dealing in these so-called lucrative business schemes, launched by the Company.”Allan, the ex-president of OneCoin, has meanwhile previously been implicated in similar pyramid schemes to OneCoin, namely Crypto888 and Brilliant Carbon. Correspondence originally from January 2015 would appear to suggest that Ignatova and Allan had a falling out, with Ignatova describing “betrayal of trust” and Allan as “illoyal” (presumably with the intended meaning of ‘disloyal’).It is clear that despite the apparent experience of its leadership in creating tools to con consumers into investing money, the claims made by OneCoin are easily revealed as fabrication.OneCoin’s style uses prestige and public presence to create an image of importance and legitimacy. The so-called ‘OneAwards’ claim to reward successful traders, who are invited to the organization’s award events. These events also double as fundraisers for the One World Foundation’s “projects.”“OneAwards incentivize the success stories. We award such as Black Di[a]mond and Double Di[a]mond. Being part of this exclusive cirlcle [sic] comes with awards, luxury items such as Rolex watches, Cash Bonuses, and Luxury cruise holidays. Other members will be inspired by your achievement – and realize what huge opportunities One offers.” – OneCoin.euIt was the most recent event in Dubai that prompted James Dollahan to send out his own advisory regarding OneCoin’s practices. Dollahan, who works for Filipino consulting firm Worldwide Summit, confirmed to Cointelegraph in emailed comments that a group of associates had attended the Dubai event, along with “approximately 3,000” others. He explained:“They met with the owners and managers of Onecoin and yes, their behavior and things said were just as I had warned them about.  Nothing that could be verified except on their own websites […]. Regarding technical questions, they were not detailed in their answers and much did not make sense to them based on what true crypto currencies are.”According to OneCoin.eu, 650,000 OneCoins as well as “50.000 cash” of undetermined currency were donated to the One World Foundation during the event.Dollahan’s concern was piqued by a separate marketing stunt featuring Ignatova herself. An alleged interview was published on the front page of Forbes Bulgaria for its May 2015 issue, which OneCoin subsequently publicized on its website and circulated in paper form at the Dubai event.While OneCoin refers to it as an “interview”, however, upon closer inspection it becomes clear that the material is a paid advertisement. The cover uploaded on OneCoin.eu does not match that from Forbes’ own website. Dollahan circulated an email exchange appearing to contain confirmation of the paid ad campaign from Forbes, which is still being verified at the time of writing.The One World Foundation, publicized as the main spin-off of OneCoin, claims to help disadvantaged children through donations gathered via OneCoin’s operation and special events.Its website states it is “supporting” various organizations including One Laptop per Child and Seva, but gives no information about how exactly it does so. A ticker on the homepage states at the time of writing that 73 children have been “helped,” yet again no further information is provided.The Foundation also states its mission is to “empower children and youth to learn about today’s economy. To make them responsible adults, who understand money and who can build up a prosperous life.” It is not clear how these objectives are being fulfilled by the alleged support.OneCoin’s apparent partner, Aurum Coin, meanwhile has seen little activity since November 2014, with Bitcointalk debate highlighting the lack of backed-up claims and plentiful scam reports.OneCoin is variously stated to be registered in Gibraltar and Ignatova’s alleged home country of Bulgaria. Regardless of its base, however, it is conspicuous that the USA is among the “restricted” countries with the website stating:“Marketing Partner Applications may not be accepted from residents within these territories, or there may be limited payment options available.”In its review of OneCoin, BehindMLM.com suggests that this is because “OneCoin would easily fall foul of SEC regulation concerning the offering of unregistered securities.”What makes OneCoin most likely to be pure fabrication is nonetheless a simple fact. Nowhere on resources such as CoinMarketCap is OneCoin to be found. No information regarding its technical specifications can be easily found and is impossible to verify.Cointelegraph would recommend to readers that they do not commence dealings with OneCoin, its spin-offs or associates. Similarly, any other projects linked to the actors mentioned in this article should be avoided at all costs.We hope that you liked this article.

Jaded Satoshis: An Interview with Kristov Atlas,Jamie Redman,2015-05-09 11:16:26,1294,0,"Recently, Jackson Palmer, creator of Dogecoin called the crypto community ""toxic"" and said he was leaving the space. Palmer, and others like him, could be called a “jaded Satoshi.” What causes some people to tire and give up on crypto?Bitcoin has been through a hellish run since 2009. The following stresses may cause people to become “jaded.”The first problems in Bitcoin involved finding value. Almost from the beginning, a malay of researchers and economists chimed in through various media outlets to give their two cents on the subject.The problem with value wasn't necessarily a bad thing. It produced numerous amounts of new research and new discussion about money: What is money? How is it derived? How it's regressed, and so forth. Although these debates sometimes seemed negative, their consequence was  to add value to Bitcoin, and to begin a meaningful study of new ways to define money.Then came the hackers. The media reports on these events like no others. Services can get hacked and compromised, but Bitcoin's code cannot. I say 'services' because as of yet, no one can break the Bitcoin Protocol. Hacks happen and persist because service companies and users themselves don't take the necessary precautions in protecting assets. For instance, people leave serious amounts of money on exchanges because it’s convenient for trading. Yet they should be prepared to lose at any time what you are holding there. They take this risk in exchange for the time it takes to transfer funds. They take this risk when they leave their wealth with a third party. We’ve had scammers and shady actors associated with theft and fraudulent activity. The Mark Karpeles, Ryan Kennedys and others perhaps influenced by the mafia. A lot of people will tell you that these so called grifters were exposed well before they did anything shady. This is why scrutinizing is not a bad thing and sometimes can be a very good thing. This community is very much based on reputation and delivering an actual product.The wild swings in the price of Bitcoin cause some to give up. We all heard the dreaded ""worst investment of 2014"" articles come out. Most enthusiasts grinning and bearing the outlash. While community members continue to protect the good name of bitcoin and all its Satoshis. They stay mean and protective like the honey badger. ""We don't care what you think. The honey badger doesn't care."" ""It's just a great time to buy"" are the rally cries.Calling people who are overprotective 'jaded' might be the wrong term. It's possible to become so but there are very few people who've left due to this feeling. There are rare occurrences where one could get so burnt out from the uphill Bitcoin battle that they leave.Perhaps people who feel this way should just leave? Maybe the real “jaded Satoshis” should stand up and walk away. Many are trying to progress and find ""real"" solutions.There are many things that can help alleviate the symptoms of this edgy honey badger type feeling. Reputation systems like Bitrated which establishes identity and reputation networks will help protect the consumer and the crypto ecosystem. Exchanges, brokers, and online wallet services can insure the funds they hold, keep better security like offering multisig and two factor authentication adding more trust to the environment. Overall education in the crypto space could be amped up to teach people to be more precautious.There are some legitimately burnt out people out here. Most though are just very protective of the space in which they help to create. The community is stronger than ever and the fact is there are very few real “jaded Satoshis” out there.I spoke with Bitcoin security researcher Kristov Atlas to get his opinion on the matter. Kristov is aware of the battles faced within crypto scene. He has his own blog and he has written a book about Bitcoin privacy and security called Anonymous Bitcoin.Cointelegraph: Sometimes the Bitcoin community can make a person burnt out. Would you agree with that?Kristov Atlas: Absolutely. Tons of people in the Bitcoin community are feeling burned out right now. We’ve had a lot of sprints in Bitcoin in terms of price changes and adoption, and the last year or so has been more of a grind. Some people became involved in Bitcoin several years before I did, and may feel that much more burned out. We’re slowly realizing that Bitcoin is not going to be a series of sprints, but a marathon.It’s always been a challenging culture to live and work in, composed of geniuses, altruists, idealists, crooks, and the just plain strange people that you find in any early adopter community. During these “grind” periods, that just gets more exaggerated, as some of the rocket fuel enthusiasm that binds us together is temporarily expended.CT: Would you consider yourself overprotective at times or jaded enough to walk away? For instance like the recent departure of the Doge creator.KA: When things feel stagnant, it’s healthy to question faiths and beliefs. “Man, the price has really been down in the dumps. Can this crazy Internet money really work out, after all?” It’s also healthy to take a break if you’ve been heavily emotionally invested and are feeling burned out. I hope all of the participants in the Bitcoin community feel welcome to take breaks as they are needed.That said, for those of us who believe in the technology for the right reasons, they will just be breaks. We’ll step away from the projects for a while or dial down the intensity, but then we’ll come back. Those of us who are involved for made-up reasons will inevitably lose interest and fade away.“I would encourage you to listen to that jadedness and act accordingly.”CT: What would you say to people in the community who feel truly jaded?KA: Re-examine the source of your initial passion for cryptocurrencies. Do you want to revolutionize the world by democratizing commerce? That’s still the plan. Rest a bit, and come back when you’re feeling excited again. Do you want to usher in a new era of dispassion for wealth, personal authenticity, gender inclusion, and dog memes? This is probably not the right space for you, and I would encourage you to listen to that jadedness and act accordingly.CT: What keeps you going strong facing some of the negative aspects of the brave new world we call Bitcoin?KA: As you eloquently pointed out, much of what goes wrong in the Bitcoin ecosystem is utterly predictable. To avoid total burnout, I try to pace myself, and maintain visibility of the big picture. For people like you and me, our big picture is very big, indeed. The end of war. Collapse of corrupt, globe-spanning institutions. The incredible kinds of improvements in human life that are enabled by voluntary exchange. I find it helpful to keep those big goals in sight as I tackle the smaller steps along the way.CT: What solutions would you suggest that could cure the feeling of getting too edgy like a honey badger? Or should some of it stay?KA: I’ve noticed a lot of people in Bitcoin, including myself at times, fall prey to ego identification with Bitcoin. We’re so excited by it, so moved by its potential, and work so hard on growing it that we mistake it for ourselves. Then, when others loft criticisms at it — usually piggishly thoughtless, ignorant ones — we take personal offense.When I notice I feel hurt by a criticism of this kind, I find it helpful to take a step back and remind myself that it’s not personal for the critic. It’s usually driven by the fact that Bitcoin makes some people uncomfortable. We’re upsetting the status quo, and people will lash out along the way. That’s something we can mentally prepare ourselves for, so it does not come as quite a shock.If we were all a little more like the honey badger, we’d probably be better off. Remember: honey badger doesn’t get angry, he just doesn’t care. When the venomous snakes of the world bite you: take a nap, and then wake up and eat them.",[]
An Estimated $12 Million in Bitcoin Disappears in Dark Market Scam,Matchpool,2015-03-19 19:12:18,1063,0,"The rise of online drug markets have led to a new form of drug dealing. Rather than gravitating to dark alleyways, dealing can now be done sitting in bed in one’s underwear. That doesn't mean drug dealing is any less of a risky businesses though. People get cheated all the time. Case in point: on Tuesday, leaders of Evolution, one of the largest online drug markets, shuttered the drug market and ran off with all user funds.Evolution, like other online drug markets, used bitcoin as a medium of exchange. Leaders Verto and Kimble ran off with an estimated $12 million in bitcoin. The shuttering of its doors could be a major reason the price of bitcoin took a nosedive from around the $290 mark to around $255.Some lost a huge chunk of money in the swindle. “I have lost everything I had worked for over the past year. That was my retirement fund,” one user said.The underground bazaar filled the void of other closed markets such as Silk Road and Silk Road 2.0, but it was known as a darker version of its predecessors. For example, identity theft was a thriving business on the eBay-like market. One user named DeepThroat threatened to 'doxx' (to make someone’s identity public on the internet) the fraudsters, something that is frowned upon, but nothing seems to have come of these threats. Of course, this is nothing new. Atlantis, another dark market, turned out to be a scam. Drug dealers lost when Silk Road was shuttered by the FBI. “Great. I've lost on SR1, BMR, Sheep, Cannabis Road, and now Evo[lution]. Except this time I lost all I had. So maybe it's a sign to move on from the DNM. Fucking fuck me running,” one user said. When the price of bitcoin plunged early this year, drug dealers also panicked.Some are saying that OpenBazaar, a more decentralized market which also uses bitcoin, might be the future for online drug dealers. Critics roll their eyes and insist that the market isn't intended for drugs. It's an open source project though, and that means anyone can fork the code and modify it. OpenBazaar is a fork of DarkMarket which had a more ambiguous, and perhaps “darker” purpose in mind, after all.If history is our guide we can be pretty sure that online drug markets will continue to thrive. Perhaps they'll even multiply. As long as there are people willing to take the risk for profit, and the anonymizing browser Tor lives on, these markets will probably stick around. Did you enjoy this article?

Scam Exposed: Crypto Media Outlets Targeted by Fraud Ring,Allen Scott,2015-02-19 12:26:57,301,0,"Cointelegraph has uncovered a profit sharing scheme where self-proclaimed “hackers” lure unsuspecting clients to sell their coins after reading promotional articles purportedly posted on crypto media outlets such as NewsBTC and CryptoCoinsNews.As the old adage goes, when something is too good to be true, it probably is. This appears to be the case with at least one website btcgoi.com, which claims to purchase bitcoins directly from clients via hacked PayPal accounts at above market value at ~US$259 compared to the current market price of ~US$236.Speaking to an online customer service representative by the name of “Elizabeth A.,” I was told that the reason the website can buy at above market price is because they are running “a promotional offer” that is “available only for few days.” Due to the current low price of bitcoin, the representative explained that they can “afford to pay 10 % more than market value … in order to satisfy customers.”Interestingly enough, Elizabeth replied that they nevertheless “will buy bitcoins almost all the time... only this period we offer a good price in order to attract customers till march,” after which, I was asked if I would like to sell some coins.Apparently, the scheme operates by paying out customers for their coins (from hacked PayPal accounts) above market price for small amounts at first. Then, after the customer sees that these transactions are successful, they will sell larger bitcoin amounts, after which the payments will no longer go through and the customer is left with no bitcoins and no money.This was uncovered after we received a press release earlier this month, which raised a lot of red flags. So we decided to dig deeper and got in touch with one of the people behind the service, known only by the skype name SterBlich.Eyeing a potentially large windfall, SterBlich was eager to divulge all of the details to Cointelegraph regarding how the scheme works offering a 50/50 profit split with the “partner” media outlet.SterBlich listed a few media partners that his group worked with already, specifically:SterBlich touted that CCN and NewsBTC allegedly received 75 and 35 BTC, within 24 hours from the scheme, respectively. When asked whether CryptoCoinsNews did in fact cooperate with SterBlich in the scheme, CCN Director David Parker replied:""[SterBlich] published a sponsored story that he paid for with a PayPal account he had hacked. We realized that once we got a refund request from PayPal. The funds were refunded to the rightful owner and the story was removed.""Bitcoinist CEO, Mate Tokay, meanwhile shared the following information with Cointelegraph:""SterBlich reached out to Bitcoinist for advertising and wanted to start some sort of shady cooperation. Later they claimed this:‘look brotha i will be straight we are a group of hackers who have lots of websites running adwords/facebookads/bing/press releases join with us and get your half :) stop work your ass for few cents for exemple [sic] when you advertised one of our website btclowen we made 63 btc only from your website and much much more from newsbtc (the thing is that we really make the payments via bank or paypal ... of course with frauded ones but still )’“After that I blocked them from my skype.""NewsBTC Business Development Manager, Samuel Rae, issued the following response:“Btcgoi approached us late last week in an attempt to purchase a press release to be published on the site. The release was to detail them buying BTC at market price +10%. We recognized it as a scam and instantly ceased communication with the ‘company.’ We have had no further communication, and have at no point received funds, BTC or otherwise, from them.”One of the media sites not allegedly involved, according to SterBlich, is CoinDesk as they chose not to cooperate with the group “because they make already lots of money from legally shet [sic],” he explained.Promising Cointelegraph a potentially hefty sum of 100BTC to publish a btcgoi.com press release, SterBlich said that “we will make much more than NewsBTC and other low pr sites.”It is uncertain whether the aforementioned crypto media websites actually received any funds or cooperated with SterBlich as it is possible that the numbers were simply thrown around to incentivize Cointelegraph to become the latest complicit victim.Additionally, SterBlich claims that he has “plenty” of other fraudulent websites that are used for these purposes, namely:And possible many others, which he failed to mention.The cryptocurrency space is undoubtedly still a “wild west” that can offer as much opportunity as risk. With the suppressed bitcoin price and stiff competition, it is not surprising that many within the space are taking advantage of unwary customers by resorting to unethical means of securing an easy profit.Cointelegraph advises its readers to be careful and always do your homework before sending money to someone online, especially when using cryptocurrencies since there is no real way to get your funds back if the other party reneges on a promised payment. Multi-signature secured transactions, for example, are a good way to circumvent this problem of trust and ensure that your funds are safe. Because otherwise, if it’s too good to be true, then…I think you already know.Below you will find two screenshots as well as the full transcript of the skype conversation between me and SterBlich who explained how the scheme works in detail:[1:18:25 PM] allen: addy gave me your contact info[1:18:57 PM] SterBlich: oh ok[1:19:12 PM] SterBlich: did he explain you how is the things ?[1:19:20 PM]

"Daily Digest: Hong Kong Issues Bitcoin Warning, Russia Reconsiders Stance, and BitPesa Raises US$1.1 Million",Aaron van Wirdum,2015-02-10 13:51:51,219,0,"Amidst the alleged sudden bankruptcy of Hong Kong-based Bitcoin trading and investment company MyCoin.hk, which might have lost customers almost $400 million in bitcoin, Hong Kong’s central bank has warned against investing in virtual currencies. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority said in a statement late Monday that the case may involve fraud or pyramid schemes, adding:“Given the highly speculative nature of Bitcoin, we have all along urged the public to exercise extra caution when considering making transactions or investments with Bitcoin.”The crypto-anarchist hackers collective unSystem has developed a new tool built to set information free. Darkleaks lets users leak data in an anonymous environment in exchange for bitcoin. According to the developers:“We give the world a new scheme for selling information of any type, form or kind. This is a gift for you to stop corruption and challenge power.”BitPesa, the Nairobi-based remittance service using bitcoin, announced that it's raised US$1.1 million in a second round of funding led by San Francisco-based Pantera Capital. Furthermore, Dan Morehead, Pantera’s CEO and founder, joined the startup’s board of directors. Other investors include Crypto Currency Partners, Stephens Investment Management, Bitcoin Opportunity Corp., and Future/Perfect Ventures.Adding another chapter to Russia's fickle history regarding cryptographic currencies, the Ministry of the Interior of the Russian Federation (MVD) issued new statements on bitcoin. The agency suggested it would wait on a decision of the country’s central bank before taking any action on matters of policy. Which is noteworthy, in particular because Bank of Russia officials seemed relatively favorable to digital currency in the past.Approximately 105 bitcoins and 900 litecoins have been seized by federal law enforcement officials, along with hundreds of golden and silver bars and coins as well as luxury items including sports cars, wedding rings and a diamond-encrusted Rolex. Target of the seizure was a Seattle-based business operator who is said to have sold and distributed counterfeit software. At the time of seizure, the bitcoins and litecoins added up to more than US$25,000 worth.Co-working and co-living space 20Mission, former home to Bitcoin startups such as Blockchain.info, 37Coins, Tradehill, Piper Wallet, and PurseIO, announced the launch of Nakamoto's electronics, the first Bitcoin retail store in San Francisco.Andrew Lee, CEO of Purse.io commented on Nakamoto's launch:“It is a great way to onboard new users with goods and products that they can pick up and physically touch. We’ll have a BTM (Bitcoin ATM) on site so if you don’t have Bitcoin and only have cash you can purchase Bitcoin and take your discount on the spot.""BitX, the bitcoin enterprise with a specific focus on emerging markets such as Kenya and Malaysia, has now opened an office in Jakarta, Indonesia. In doing so, CEO Marcus Swanepoel has brought his services to a population of 252 million people in one of the world's fastest-growing economies. BitX Indonesia will recruit local staff to provide user support in a language and style familiar to the region's customers.Swanepoel:""[Indonesia is] very relationship-driven, so you need to spend a lot of time on the ground, have local teams with local understanding and networks, local operating structures, and also spend a lot more time in building a brand that people can trust, as these are often very low-trust environments.""Perhaps somewhat surprisingly, Bitreserve CEO Halsey Minor has stated in a blog post that he thinks the term “bitcoin” won't be around in five years from now. Instead, he says, Bitcoin will kickstart an entire movement and shift in how society works. Minor said:“Bitcoin is poised to be the Netscape of the digital currency movement. It’s not a future currency but a system for better money transmission.”It is probably one of the most controversial issues within the Bitcoin community: the 1MB block size limit. While some say this limit must be removed or at the very least increased in order for the network to scale, others believe that such modifications might endanger the decentralized nature of the protocol, or render mining infeasible. Discussions on the subjected have been heating up on r/bitcoin and Bitcointalk over the last couple of days.Not exactly news, but interesting in light of recent developments nonetheless: the new Greek minister of finance Yanis Varoufakis debated Andreas Antonopoulos on Bitcoin back in march 2014. Unsurprisingly, it is well worth the listen. As for the question if Varoufakis really is as negative regarding as some say? Judge for yourself:“There is a big tragedy here with Bitcoin, which has two folds. My lot, economists, fail to see the brilliance of it. The brilliance of the algorithm, and the fact that it has a great deal of potential. The Bitcoin cheerleaders [on the other hand] abide by a very primitive and dangerously flawed theory of money.”Did you enjoy this article? You may also be interested in reading these ones:",[]
"Cloud Mining Service Hashie.co Disappears With User Funds, Replaces Site With ARG",Ian DeMartino,2014-12-29 19:47:50,377,0,"Art By: Jing JinCloud mining is risky business. Bitcoin mining in general can be risky business, but cloud mining in particular requires a lot of trust. Essentially, you are sending someone money on the promise that they will send you more money back. There is a lot of talk about hardware and cloud mining and state of the art facilities with giant server racks filled with powerful ASICs. At any given service, those things may or may not exist and few things can be done to make sure they exist. Hashie.co, a cloud mining service that claims over 40,000 users, has suspended operations. Users have lost their hash tokens but users who purchased AMHash tokens through Hashie.co are able to move their tokens to AMHash. In a bizarre twist, someone has turned the site into an Alternate Reality Game (ARG) and the first few clues have already been solved. Yes, let me repeat that for you: A site that sold virtual hashing power to mine a digital currency “in the cloud” has vanished with user funds and has replaced the service with an online ARG, and users are playing along. Several days ago, users started complaining about missing payouts at Hashie.co. Hashie.co was already suspect in the minds of some users, because it didn't publish public Bitcoin addresses that proved the owners were actually mining any bitcoin. Cloudmining is a market that appears to be tailor made for a Ponzi scheme. In Ponzi schemes, owners will take new investor money to pay back older investors. When the money gathered from the new investors outpaces the money put in from old investors, the Ponzi scheme is able to give the appearance of successful investment, when in reality it is being held afloat by incoming victims. The constant need for new victims makes maintaining Ponzi scheme impossible to sustain over the long term. Cloudmining lends itself to this kind of scam, because investors are not always looking for quick high yield returns and there are few regulatory agencies in place. Hashie.co tempted users with unusually low prices and the promise of a free 10GH/s mining machine (but users would have to “buy” another machine before they could get payouts). Hashie.co also sold mining contracts for a separate site, AMHash, which will honor the AMHash contracts purchased on Hashie.co. Hashie.co's own hashing contracts and its “FireHashers” are separate from AMHash and will not be carried over. At this point, it appears that anyone awaiting a payout from Hashie.co's “Gen 1” miners or “FireHasher” miners have lost their funds. AMHash claims to be a seperate entity entirely from Hashie.co and also claims to not know who the owner of Hashie.co is. An announcement on Bitcoin talked described Hashie.co as an authorized reseller of AMHash. Hashie.co user complaints started as early as late November but things really began picking up this weekend as more users complained of the site missing the payout date. By the December 27, the site's welcome page had been replaced with an MP3 playing the song Let it Go from the movie Frozen. ARGs are games that typically exist within communities online. Players can be anyone who decides to participate in figuring out a series of puzzles until the announcement or reward is revealed. One of the earliest popular iterations of an ARG was videogame developer Bungie's “ilovebees” game used to hype the announcement of HALO 2. The first puzzle in the Hashie.co game was solved by users finding a hidden Morse Code message in the song. That pointed to a URL which led to other clues that led to still more clues. Some users are hoping that figuring out the puzzle will convince the site to continue withdraws, while others are hoping for a promised 20 BTC prize; at least a few are playing out of pure curiosity. A message board and chatroom have been opened up for victims wanting to play the game. Unconfirmed reports have the total amount of BTC missing from the site to be around 1481 BTC, according to a Bitcoin address that has been linked to several Hashie.co accounts. The scammer, who may or may not be the owners of Hashie.co seem to be having fun with the victims. Inexplicably, the victims have fed into the scammer's ego by following the game obsessively. But scammers aren't in the business of giving money back, even to those who feed their ego. The real game has already been played. Nearly 1500 BTC was at stake. The scammer won those and is now dancing on the 50-yard-line. It seems some of his victims have decided to dance with him.Did you enjoy this post? You may also enjoy these:  ",[]
Bitalo.com Puts Massive 100BTC Bounty On Hacker,Ian DeMartino,2014-11-03 19:09:29,220,0,"Art By: Jing JinBack in September, we reported on a blackmailer/hacker who had been DDOS attacking the popular bitcoin sports book Nitrogensports.eu and then blackmailing them into paying a ransom for it to stop.Today, we have been informed by Bitalo.com, a “multi-signature wallet and decentralized exchange” with that they are the latest victim of attacks by the same hacker. The site was offline for two days before coming back online shortly before publishing. Bitalo.com's owners have informed us that rather than give into the hacker's demands, they will be putting up a bounty on the hacker who goes by the pseudonym “DD4BC”. Information leading to his identity will win the bounty, worth 100 BTC.This would make it the largest escrow-powered Bitcoin bounty put on find the identity of anyone person. Roger Ver's Bounty hunters site currently lists bounties for the identity of four people, the largest of which are of the Satoshi  and Roger Ver email hacker and whoever has control of the lost Mt. Gox funds.  Those bounties currently sit at 37.6 and 2.1 BTC respectively. This bounty is significantly higher than both.Bitalo.com is a German based decentralized multi-service platform that acts as more than just an exchange (also has a marketplace and airbnb funcationality) and gives users full control over their own funds via multi-signature wallets and presigned backup transactions. Because users, and not Bitalo, keep control of user's keys, user funds are completely safe under virtually any circumstance. The site came back online during the writing of this article, but the site owners are still upgrading their DDoS protection. If they site goes down again, users can still access their funds by moving them to the backup wallet they designated when they signed up for the site via a backup transaction.We have received email messages from the alleged hacker to Bitalo, confirming that the attempt at blackmail took place. As was the case in the Nitrogenspot.eu situation, the hacker has been taking down sites and then demands a tribute to teach the site how to prevent DDoS attacks. As was in the case in those communications, DD4BC claims to perform similar attacks on other Bitcoin sites, who he (or she, or they) claim pay the ransom. It is unknown at this time if his claims are true.The anonymity careful actors are able to obtain using the Internet and Bitcoin, combined with the relative lack of law enforcement in the Bitcoin space, has resulted in a bit of a wild west feel. That feeling is amplified with blackhat hackers attempting to appear like a whitehat hacker by claiming that their actions are actually a service to the community. Whatever argument some may make about semi-malicious hackers (or “gray hats”) improving security overall, DDoS attacks do not demonstrate any vulnerability when it comes to securing consumer funds, or anything other than the site's ability to withstand a DDoS attack. Since Bitalo was designed to keep users in control of their funds, DD4BC's contribution to the community at this point seems to be nil.In any case, he now has at least 100 BTC hanging over his head. According to the email conversation he had with Bitalo, DD4BC is confident that his identity will not be revealed online. But 100BTC, or roughly USD $32,764 at the current exchange rate, will be a powerful motivator for any real whitehat hackers out there.We have been told that they have filled out the proper forms to get the bounty on Roger Ver's bounty site. In the meantime, anyone with information on DD4BC's identity is encouraged to email [email protected]/* <![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=""currentScript""in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(""script""),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(""cf-hash""))return t[e]}();if(t&&t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(""data-cfemail"");if(a){for(e="""",r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]> */.",[]
"The Mystery of the Missing 1,000,000 NXT",Edward DeLeon Hickman,2014-09-30 15:43:53,445,0,"In a series that I hope I rarely have to write, I cast a light on the somewhat unsavory elements that exist in our burgeoning eco-system. My hope being that such elements cannot survive the light of day. That by merely exposing their actions we can in some way diminish the upside of partaking in them.However, to quote the great Mr. Moustafa himself: “When the destiny of a great fortune is at stake, men's greed spreads like a poison in the bloodstream.”Now this brings us to our very first case dealing with the now notorious “Blue Meanie” aka Joshua Zeidner of Altchain. I stumbled upon this case while researching an unrelated story but was immediately reminded of a saying my father once imparted upon me and that I think bears significant relevance to this case:“A pickpocket goes through life with his hand on his wallet because he’s sure someone will steal it and an honest man just assumes everyone is always telling the truth.”The overarching lesson being that we project ourselves onto the world around us. Meaning you can always tell a lot about a person by the types of accusations and claims they consistently make about others. To liars the world is full of liars. To crooks everyone is out to cheat them.An important lesson to keep in mind as we progress forward into this curious tale…It begins, as so many stories begin, with a proposition. NXT’s top market maker Jl777 aka “James”, while seeking opportunity around the creation of DACs (that’s distributed autonomous corporations for the uninitiated) petitioned “Blue Meanie” to begin development work on a new undertaking that would be crowd funded and listed under the name “NXTautoDAC”.Now Blue Meanie denied to me in email that he ever agreed to take part in or promote “NXTautoDac” however here he is in a PGP signed message promoting the digital asset: Now what “NXTautoDAC” does or was intended to do is less important to understand than the terms of the agreement. According to sources in the NXT community that agreement was something akin to as follows:1) “Blue Meanie” aka Joshua Zeidner will receive 1,000,000 NXT and 300,000 NXTautoDAC units in exchange for development work directly related to the project.And that’s pretty much it. Not the most complicated of scenarios I know but these things sometimes escape us. Unfortunately, according to sources on the development team it seems Joshua Zeidner not only failed to login even once to work on the project, he also began a long string of convoluted accusations levied at Jl777 and the NXT community; ranging from threats to call the FBI and the SEC to accusations of NXT community members being part of the Russian Mob.- Joshua Zeidner did not login even once to work on the projectAt one point he got as far as to suggest “money was transferred (sic) to me.  It was worth roughly 15k.” However, when pressed for the actual amount in terms of NXT he was quick to evade the issue and to attempt to point the finger elsewhere without actually ever saying how much NXT he had received.If only there was some kind of… “publically available distributed ledger” that was capable of proving that at around the time NXTautoDAC was being formed an account already known to be under Jl777’s control actually sent 1,000,000 NXT to an account already known to be associated with and controlled by “Blue Meanie” (pssst! It’s the same one that Joshua used to issue his ALTCHAIN asset on May 23rd, 2014). I mean this isn’t a futuristic sci-fi film where everyone trades galactic credits on a global consensus platform… here in the real world we have to rely on actual evidence, right?-Transactions permformedNaturally I thought Joshua deserved to offer his perspective on the whole sordid affair. So I was relieved when I contacted him via twitter for comment and was immediately met with a short flurry of responses, not the least of which was:I could tell he and I were going to get along famously.The contributions valiant bloggers make to the field of journalism notwithstanding, we eventually got past our initial awkwardness and were able to clear a few things up via email. Indeed, during our correspondence I was able to ascertain a few things about him that seemed highly relevant to this case.The first thing I learned was that even after emailing him from my company outbox, identifying myself as a writer, showing him where he can find samples of my work, and pointing him towards my Linkedin Profile (that is quite specific and open about who I am), he remained ever the skeptic about my identity. Perhaps he just didn’t want to embarrass himself by sharing info with someone not as important as him? His motives as such remain unclear.What is clear, however, is that he seems to belong to that special class of citizen that completely lacks the ability to ever answer a direct question. Multiple times I gave him the opportunity to clear the matter up with direct questions, finally even resorting to a numbering system (because you never know maybe he struggles with context):- Email conversation screenshotThe first question, which I had asked numerous times throughout our dialogue, seems simple enough but its one Joshua refused to answer time and time again. Thankfully, we live in post blockchain times and I don’t necessarily need him to verify whether he received 1 million NXT, I simply need him to explain why he is being duplicitous about clarifying the nature of the transaction.The second question was to determine what, if any, influence “Blue Meanie” has had on Jeff Garzik’s recent, heavy handed attacks on NXT. While I have been unable to reach Jeff Garzik directly for comment there does at least seem to be a running dialogue between the two on twitter.  While I would not assert a substantive relationship between the two at this time, I would like to hear what Jeff (whom I have mentioned in my work before and admire sincerely) has to say on the matter.When I reached out to find out more about this case, I was bowled over with responses (this must be what Joshua has repeatedly referred to as the “sockpuppet brigade” but I would loosely refer to as “community”). While I’m certain a great deal of the claims forwarded to me were inflammatory and lack merit, I was directed towards something Chris Odom (the big brain whom we should all be thanking for bringing us Open Transactions) mentioned about Blue Meanie:- Chris OdomThis was more or less my impression of “Blue Meanie” as well but being unprofessional and abrasive is hardly a criminal offense. Actually come to think of it, given the fact that regulation surrounding unforgeable digital tokens is still an unclear matter, there’s not much else to do here except say that we as a community should strongly consider policing ourselves.Many people still fear blockchain based applications like Bitcoin as unsafe and unregulated. To which I say that they are only as a safe or as dangerous as we make them. Much in the way we must now take personal responsibility when it comes to safeguarding our accounts we must also become more mindful of both whom we transact with and what application we use to do so.A simple escrow application such as David Zimbeck of Blackcoin’s Bit/Blackhalo, with perhaps the added feature of multisig, could have prevented this situation from arising in the first place. Since smart contracts of that nature create strong incentives to work together while also preventing funds from being released until multiple members of the dev team can sign off on the work performed.  However, until such time as those transaction types become commonplace it’s up to us to be wary and point out bad behavior whenever we can.So while I sincerely hope this series does not become a regularly occurring piece, I suspect that given the current stage of development blockchain technology is in that there will be plenty of other dubious incidents, scam artists and artful dodgers to discuss.Faced with such an abundance of deceit what else can we do but point it out with a smile?If you know of any notable cases that you’d like to see reported on, please mention the incident(s) in the comments section below. NXT users feel free to send anonymous tips and related news via my NXT account:NXT-7RUC-2LMU-XF4D-BAQ4F",[]
Butterfly Labs Finally Has Wings Clipped UPDATED: Butterfly Labs Responds,Ian DeMartino,2014-09-23 19:49:46,179,0,"Art by: Jing JinUPDATE: Butterfly Labs has issued an official comment, which can be found in its entirety below this article.The tale of Butterfly Labs may finally be drawing to a close. After unconfirmed weekend rumors that the federal authorities had raided Butterfly Labs' headquarters, the FTC has requested and was granted an injunction, preventing Butterfly Labs from selling anymore hardware while also freezing its assets pending the investigation.Butterfly Labs has been at the center of controversy nearly since its inception. Pre-ordered hardware almost always shipped late, leaving miners who had calculated profits based on energy consumption predictions, the hashing power of the hardware and Bitcoin's predicted difficulty level in the cold. The problem was that when mining equipment arrived late, Bitcoin's difficulty was higher and the profits Butterfly Labs' hardware should have produced were impossible to realize.This allegedly resulted in investments that should have brought large returns instead resulting in modest returns or worse, sharp losses. The order, which was first uncovered by the National Journal, states that there is good cause to believe that Butterfly Labs violated “Section 5(a) of the FTC Act” and would be a threat to current consumers if they were allowed to continue to operate and would also be a risk at laundering their assets. As is typical in these situations, Butterfly Labs is required to keep all their records and FTC officers have been granted access to their grounds.It is unclear if the FTC was successfully able to sieze any holding Butterfly Labs holds in digital currencies, although they would presumably be treated like any other asset from a legal sense.In addition to the corporation Butterfly Labs itself, Darla Drake, Nasser Ghoseiri, and Sonny Vleisides are named as defendants. Ghoseiri is Butterfly Labs' Chief Technology Officer, Vleisides is listed as the company's innovation officer but is also the company's co-founder. There is no one listed as Darla Drake on Butterfly Lab's management page, but there is a Jody Drake, who serves as the company's General Manager and significantly, runs its customer service department.The issues caused by Butterfly Labs' inability to ship its hardware at a reasonable time resulted in it having one of the worst reputations in the industry, Recently, customers brought a class action lawsuit against the company.That lawsuit seems unrelated, at least in a legal sense, from this one, which the FTC hopes will result in customers receiving their lost funds. That is, if the company or the other defendants are found culpable. We should find out more on September 29th, which is when the court will decide if Butterfly Labs' assets should be frozen for the duration of the trial or not.  Customers hoping for a refund will likely have to wait until after the court's proceedings.The FTC hosted a Twitter question and answer session about the situation today.The following is Butterfly Lab's official statement on the matter:“Butterfly Labs is disappointed in the heavy-handed actions of the Federal Trade Commission.  In a rush to judgment, the FTC has acted as judge, jury and executioner, contrary to our intended system of governmental checks and balances.  The FTC's current actions are negatively impacting our thousands of customers and our dozens of employees.  Their current media campaign should only further alarm a knowing citizenry and raise questions as to why the FTC wouldn't simply let this case play out through the judicial system.  That is what Butterfly Labs intends to do.   It appears the FTC has decided to go to war on bitcoin overall, and is starting with Butterfly Labs.  Butterfly Labs is being portrayed by the FTC as a bogus and fake company.  To the contrary, Butterfly Labs is very real.  As pointed out in court filings Butterfly Labs made last night, Butterfly Labs has shipped more than $33 million in products to customers and voluntarily granted refunds approximating $17 million to customers for cancelled orders.  Butterfly Labs was literally is in the midst of shipping out completed products to fulfill the remaining millions of dollars of orders on our books and issuing requested refunds, when the FTC effectively closed the doors of Butterfly Labs without any chance to be heard in court. At this time, Butterfly Labs is cooperating fully with the Temporary Receiver appointed by the Court.  A hearing is set for September 29 and Butterfly Labs has asked the Court to allow it to present testimony from key witnesses for the company.  Butterfly Labs intends to defend our business and our nascent and promising industry.  The government wants to shut Butterfly Labs down, and we are not going away without a fight to vindicate bitcoin, our company, and our employees.  Our continued focus is our customers and finding a way to continue to deliver products and processing refunds for those who have requested them.”  Did you enjoy this article?

CoIntellect issues official response to scam accusations,William Suberg,2014-09-09 16:35:00,199,0,"Beleaguered Mining operation CoIntellect caused quite a stir in the past two weeks following multiple accusations of scamming, but the company has now issued an official statement on the matter.Following Cointelegraph’s carrying of an investigation by Coinality user Tom, many readers posted details of their experiences with CoIntellect, while others were defensive, noting the lack of evidence confirming the widespread suspicions and warnings.CoIntellect was also vocal on the issue unofficially, posting responses to many reader comments. The official statement is more reserved in tone, but nonetheless makes some valid points.“It should … be noted that usage of CoinMiner is not required,” the company notes in response to accusations that the client contained malware and was part of a scheme to defraud users of profits stored in accounts and wallets.The statement explains that “the current generation of mining software is largely command line based which is fairly unintuitive for new cryptocurrency users,” and that CoinMiner was developed as an “alternative” which would “streamline the mining process.”Regarding the dubious status of the application from the perspective of antivirus programs, CoIntellect reiterated the language used in comments within our previous article that this was a “false positive.”It concluded, “This problem exists in other mining software (ccminer, cudaminer, sgminer, cpuminer, bfgminer) and some cryptocurrency wallets as well. We are aware of the issue and are working on a fix.”All plausible responses indeed. Furthermore, in regard to accusations of missing or inexplicably delayed payments by some customers (also visible in the comments of our article), CoIntellect stated that “challenging terms and conditions” of its payment processor were to blame. Customers affected had already confirmed receipt of payment, however, meaning this could well have been the case.“While we always encourage a healthy dose of skepticism, continued defamation of CoIntellect will not be tolerated. Such claims will be met with litigation,” CoIntellect concludes, adding that customers are able to make arrangements to visit its office in person during office hours.While conclusive evidence has yet to be produced by either party, this last point would seem to elevate CoIntellect above other entities in the space which have faced similar accusations in the past. Indeed, organizations such as Butterfly Labs, which has been the subject of criminal proceedings for fraud, was not known for its open invitation of inspection in its retaliatory literature.Cointelegraph would like to reiterate that it remains impartial to CoIntellect regarding the accusations leveled against it, and continues coverage of developments in order to, as always, reflect live community opinion.The following is Cointellect's statement, edited only for formatting issues.To Whom It May Concern,In recent weeks, CoIntellect has been targeted by a number of news outlets questioning our operation's legitimacy. As such, we felt it necessary to provide an official statement which should provide some clarity.Perhaps the most serious allegation we would like to address is the concern that our mining software is malware. Despite not having provided any proof, some continue to claim CoinMiner is disguised as “coin-stealing malware”. This is absolutely not the case and claims of this nature are slanderous and libelous.The current generation of mining software is largely command line based which is fairly unintuitive for new cryptocurrency users. Since a large portion of our users are new to cryptocurrencies, we felt it necessary to develop our own software which provides an easy-to-use graphical interface. Instead of using command line arguments, users can opt to take advantage of CoinMiner. The goal here is to streamline the mining process for new users.It should also be noted that usage of CoinMiner is not required. Users are provided with login credentials for access to the stratum directly.Some anti-virus software will detect CoinMiner as a false positive. This problem is not exclusive to our own CoinMiner software. In the past, botnet operators would distribute mining software to infected computers. As a result, some anti-virus software will incorrectly identify mining software as malware.This problem exists in other mining software (ccminer, cudaminer, sgminer, cpuminer, bfgminer) and some cryptocurrency wallets as well. We are aware of the issue and are working on a fix.All start-up companies experience growing pains. In our case, the unexpectedly large amount of new users left us unprepared to deal with support tickets. Additionally, our payment processing merchant's challenging Terms of Use delayed some payouts. These issues have been addressed and we are continuing to expand our support team.Some users have also raised concerns regarding CoIntellect's identity. Due to the unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency industry, we have made some efforts to conceal the founding member's personal information. This approach is far from unconventional. Many of our competitors and industry peers have also taken similar precautions. Those looking to get in touch with our company are invited to visit us during office hours.We would like to remind readers that we are a cooperative project. Much of our growth is reinvested into our business and used to expand the company. Like all cryptocurrency enthusiasts, we want to see the sector thrive. Our company continues to seek talent and hire from within the industry. Those interested in our community oriented project are encouraged to apply for open positions.We hope this statement will help quell some concerns. We are far from a “fly-by-night” operation and we hope to exist in the industry for a long time. While we always encourage a healthy dose of skepticism, continued defamation of CoIntellect will not be tolerated. Such claims will be met with litigation.Sincerely,CoIntellect StaffGot something to say? Feel free to comment below this article.Did you enjoy this article?

Is CoIntellect a Scam?,Diana Ngo,2014-09-02 12:47:44,1068,0,"Several members of the community are accusing CoIntellect.com of being a scam, based on a series of evidences that should attest so.CoIntellect.com is a cloud mining service with a special emphasis on Dogecoin, allegedly based in Tallinn, Estonia, and incorporated under a company called Sonera Corporative OU. Starting from August 27, stories and articles have been published all over the Internet arguing on the legitimacy of the service.While both the website and the miner software have sleek and elegant designs, some believe that it is just a way to lure new users. Eivind Helgesen wrote on Medium:""... And it looks fancy, way fancier than any other miner software out there. It has gimmicky graphics which no other miner software has, which leads me to believe that they want to lure new users to use their software because it is so fancy.""Helgesen works part-time at a digital currency exchange. He reported being contacted by several users complaining that their funds have been maliciously withdrawn from their accounts. Some of them stated having both their desktop and web-based Bitcoin wallets being emptied and compromised, as well as their Stellar accounts. One of these users noted that this happened right after he signed up and downloaded CoIntellect's software.After scanning the mining software with VirusTotal, Helgesen said the deep antivirus malwares scan revealed 4 possibly malicious hacking viruses, including a Trojan horse:Other elements have conducted Helgesen in concluding that CoIntellect.com was scam, including its SSL-certificate belonging to an undetermined user, as well as the excessive amount of backlinks for such a small mining company. Many of these links come from porn, privacy and gambling-related websites.1a20.com also noted that CoIntellect's domain name linked back to many fishy scamming websites and businesses. According to the blog, CoIntellect, as well as CoinGeneration, CoinBeez and IPUServices, all exploit a similar scamming scheme and were most likely created by the same person(s).Helgesen added that most of the reviews of CoIntellect were certainly paid stories, as all the articles were quite similar by their content and illustrations; and indeed, many of them seem to be plain advertisements (see this article of the Daily Doge, as well as this one from TechGYD).A Coinality user and job seeker, who we will name Tom, reached out to Cointelegraph to share his experience with CoIntellect. Tom applied for a PR Manager position a couple of days ago and was directly contacted by the company.In an email communication, he wrote:""The company, which seems legitimate on the surface, and their agreement seems fairly forthcoming and nothing is out of the ordinary on it, except that they lacked a letterhead and all communications from their HR people lacked any name.""Skeptical, Tom started researching on CoIntellect's background and profile and discovered all of the previously mentioned elements that made Helgesen suspicious.Then, he received an email from CoIntellect, describing his first assignment. He was asked to promote their application, as well as work on CoIntellect's re-branding:""We'd like to ask you for your first assignment this,We have been having people complaining about our software, that is stealing Bitcoins. This is complete absurd [sic] and we need to clarify this to our customers and users.You as a PR Manager are welcome to find a reputable source that will check the source code of our software to provide evidence that everything is clean.Are you able to do that?Best Regards""Tom stated they wanted to hire him as a contracted ""PR Manager"" to “spread their application around” and have people analyze why the malware scan was showing false positives. He added that it was ""possibly as part of a scam to steal coins.""Both Helgesen and Tom pointed out that CoIntellect's social media's followers and likes were likely fake, stating that having 7500+ followers on Twitter while the account has been active for only 2 months, was a bit suspicious. Sure, paying for Facebook likes and Twitter followers isn't a big deal and surely doesn't assure whether a business is a scam or not. But in light of all the elements that have be gathered on the issue, including CoIntellect's lack of transparency and the presence of malware in its software, it would be wise to stay away from CoIntellect until official explanations are made on the issue. Did you enjoy this article?

Bitpay Targeted By Phishing Attacks Again,Carlo C,2014-08-27 04:17:20,172,0,"Phishing attacks are nothing new on the internet. While most are relatively amateurish (the African Princess) some are quite well put together and will fool most people if you are not paying attention. Phishing incidents have been happening more and more frequently in the virtual coin industry and the latest group targeted seems to be customers of BitPay, one of the largest cryptocurrency payment platforms in the world.image: Bitpay via ImgurDifferent companies react differently to events like this, but BitPay is already stepping up to the plate with a public statement to Cointelegraph about what happened and where the attack was coming from. BitPay’s public statement is as follows: There has been an email phishing attempt spoofing BitPay’s late payment notification email. As always, BitPay’s security is the main priority.  There has not been a breach to our system.  It’s very unfortunate that these malicious attacks have been made on the bitcoin community. These emails came from no_reply@bitpay.com - any link in an email from this address should not be clicked.  This email address is not a legitimate BitPay email address. Many of BitPay’s system emails do come from noreply@bitpay.com (please note the lack of an underscore in the correct address). The phishing attempt was mimicking a late payment notification from BitPay. A screenshot of the attempt can be found here: imgur.com/SHOEqpO. The attack prompts the receiver to click a link to invoice-bitpay.com - this is not a BitPay site. As soon as the phishing attempt was identified, BitPay reported the fraud attempt to the domain company and were successfully able to have the site taken down (invoice-bitpay.com).If a BitPay client has already clicked on the phishing link and entered a username and password, PLEASE go to https://bitpay.com/merchant-login and click on the Forgot Password button to reset the password immediately! To stay vigilant and avoid any breaches, always look for the green BitPay, Inc SSL certificate indicator in the browser window. Always be extra cautious about checking the domain name and EV SSL certificate when entering a password. If you use a personal computer with good password protection, let your browser store and populate userids and passwords for you -  the browser will not mistakenly enter your password on a phishing site. BitPay also strongly advises all of its merchants to enable Two-Factor Authentication on their accounts. BitPay is continually working with its merchant base to educate them on the best security practices.  Please reach out to support@bitpay.com if you have any further questions.Phishing attacks are very easy to avoid if you keep just a few rules in mind. Remember that reputable websites never ask for passwords, usernames or personal information in emails. There are also certain types of files often used in these attacks, such as .jar files, because filters are not designed to recognize them as potentially hostile.",[]
"Hong Kong's Newest Bitcoin Exchange Goes Dark, Fraud Suspected",Carlo C,2014-06-24 10:21:54,145,0,"Hong Kong police are investigating the disappearance of tens of thousands of dollars worth of Bitcoins at the HKCex exchange, which could open the doors for more victims to come forward.Everyone is familiar with Mt. Gox which lost hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Bicoins in client money forcing the company to close its doors. But while Mt. Gox was probably a victim of hackers or inside malfeasance, the recent incidents at the Hong Kong Crypto Exchange seems from all indications to have been a ponzi scheme from the beginning. Investigations by the South China Morning Post revealed that the address given by the company, 56 Belcher Street in Kennedy Town, appears to be fake as no such company operates at that address. It also turns out that the company’s ten Bitcoin ATMs distributed in Hong Kong were ficticious as well. Company spokesman Lavin Lam sent an email last month after some users experienced problems stating:""We are an honest and transparent business [and] have all the necessary permits and licences to conduct this activity.""Lam's claims notwithstanding, no one has been able to reach the company or its officers. The Hong Kong police became involved after a former IT engineer and Bitcoin investor reported that he has lost HK$ 67,000 (now closer to HK$ 80,000 due to the increase in price) through HKCex. A police spokesperson commented on the investigation:""The informant reported that he stored some virtual currency … in a company providing services on storage and trading in virtual currency in mid-May but discovered later he was unable to retrieve money from the company. Investigations are under way.""Dominic Rivers, 34, a former IT engineer, reported that he had lost HK$67,000. But while Rivers welcomes the investigation, he also seemed to not have a great deal of confidence since he believes that the police rarely take cybercrime seriously because they do not understand the technologies involved and either ignore it or lack the knowledge to catch the perpetrators.In addition to the lies about their address and the fake ATM machines in Hong Kong, HKCex showed a number of other warning signs. While it originally claimed to have secured investments totally US$27 million, it insisted on not naming the investors. The press releases of the company were only published by one website, Technode, including both the announcement about the raised funds and the ATM machines, both of which have since been taken down.The links are still viewable in cached form. But future customers looking for a cryptocurrency exchange should be wary as the promotion by Technode and the promise of a 108% return was apparently all that it took for investors like Rivers to jump onboard.",[]
Scam Alert: Sharexcoin Cryptocurrency Exchange Goes Silent,Carlo C,2014-06-11 09:22:31,135,0,"Every new industry has its ups and downs, and they all have failures, especially in the beginning. Unfortunately, this is not the first time a cryptocurrency exchange has folded and all of depositors’ money has disappeared. The Sharecoin spinoff Sharexcoin seems to have gone under completely closing its doors as the exchange (Bitcointalk ID: ziplibrary) has been silent since 3 June, 2014. Sharecoin is a new PoS cryptocurrency that was presented as a gift to all Bitcointalk forum members. Now, it appears that Sharexcoin was a Trojan horse and the complete details of the loss are still not clear. It is unknown whether the owner was hacked or that the entire thing was an elaborate sting set up by criminals. In either case, this will probably not be determined until the owner surfaces. Updates to the post can be found at the ANN thread of Sharecoin. The community, as is usually the case when this happens, is still trying to sort out the effects that this might have. Sharecoin promoted itself as being super-stable because, according to its marketing slogan, it was “the only alternate coin backed by a business.” The fact that the business was the Sharexcoin exchange was lost to no one, however. The exchange was set up to be Proof of Stake (PoS) with a yearly stake of 30% with bonuses of up to 60% if shareholders locked up their Sharecoin for 30 days, effectively doubling their profit, which sounds suspiciously like a virtual Ponzi scheme. The exchange dealt mostly with new altcoins such as Energycoin and Qora and had demonstrated a very large trading volume for the latter just before it went dark. The amount of money lost in this crash will probably not have a great deal of effect on stability but the psychological effect can become fodder for Bitcoin critics, who view crypotcurrencies as enablers of everything malicious from pyramid schemes to buying illicit drugs online. Just a few months ago one of the largest exchanges in the world, Mt Gox, lost millions of dollars in several different security breaches, eventually forcing the exchange to shutter its doors. These losses are bound to have an effect, especially in the trading markets, but it is still far too early to gauge the amount of backlash from the community. Scam exchanges like this are exactly what could give governments reason to regulate Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The losses at Mt. Gox were certainly severe enough for hearings to be held in the United States Senate. But it will be interesting to see whether news of another exchange failure will affect public confidence in cryptocurrencies and whether it will open the door for authorities to clamp down on crypto-exchanges amidst fraud allegations in the future.",[]
"Scam Alert: BTCPromo Will Exchange Bitcoins For Paypal, Except When They Don't",Ian DeMartino,2014-06-08 13:46:45,260,0,"BTCPromo is an unknown and unverified Bitcoin exchange that claims to exchange Bitcoins for Paypal payments, allowing users to potentially turn their Bitcoins into dollars stored on the Paypal network. The problem is, several customers are alleging that BTCPromo is keeping their Bitcoin and without paying for it. There are a few things that should tip off anyone savvy enough to be playing in the Bitcoin game. First, any Bitcoin to Paypal site is already suspicious. Paypal hasn't supported bitcoin in the past and if the “exchange” decides to issue a chargeback, there is little to nothing innocent bitcoiners can do about it. Second, the alleged exchange's domain name is registered in Queensland, Australia but the title is in Greek. There is also a donation button next to the Adobe logo on the site. The logo is a strange enough addition but a donation address for a site that supposedly offers a service for a fee is another major red flag. The allegation started on the Bitcointalk Internet forum and Bitcoin's subreddit. One user complained about sending bitcoin into the service and getting a few transactions through before BTCPromo allegedly stopped sending payment. Another user claims to have never gotten anything in return for his Bitcoin. The company allegedly tricked him into sending several transactions of Bitcoin by blaming technical issues, the user claims to have eventually sent BTCPromo 5 BTC, totaling over USD $3,720 at current prices. It is important to note that these allegations remain just that at press time - allegations. However, representatives from BTCPromo have posted on Bitcointalk before, so they are almost assuredly aware of the claims against them, and have yet to respond publicly. We have reached out to BTCPromo and will update you if and when they respond. It should also be noted that Paypal to BTC and BTC to Paypal sites in general are not very reputable, despite the eBay CEO's recent comments, the online fiat exchange system remains unfriendly to cryptocurrency based companies.",[]
"The Bitcoin universe: Scammers, criminals and the feds",Eric Barrier,2013-11-13 16:45:00,65,0,"For enthusiasts and the merely interested, Bitcoin has made for a remarkable story. There have been shadowy activist groups, clampdowns by governments, mail-order drug dealers and run of the mill scams at every turn.If you are an investor or a Bitcoin business, though, maybe it’s not been so fun. This is an economy that is trying to mature, after all.This begs the question: Are stability and maturity attainable? Will an unregulated marketplace with a peer to peer digital currency cannibalize itself first?Two things: First, there is a demand, and there is a need for such a currency. Second, the fact that Bitcoin’s value continues to climb has to prove the model to some extent.It’s just that Bitcoin’s activities thus far have left a lot shaken up in its wake.First came the currency’s crash back in the spring. That event left a lot of naysayers feeling pretty smug. The bubble had burst, they said. Hindsight has since proven that wrong.Next came Bitfloor’s abrupt closing after its US bank accounts were closed. The banks clearly did not want to take on the risks associated with Bitcoin then.The US government’s stance does not necessarily bolster banks’ confidence, either. On the one hand, Bitcoins could lead a trail back to cyber criminals and digital money launderers, which aids enforcement efforts. On the other hand, the US government has no real jurisdiction, and any regulations have been and will continue to be clumsy.Bitfloor taught the next generation of Bitcoin businesses was that compliance will be key going forward. At the end of October, supposedly Hong Kong-based GBL, a Bitcoin trading platform, closed up shop without warning, and $4.1 million disappeared.Red flags surrounded GBL’s activities, and a Bitcoin Talk forum moderator had warned users that GBL was probably a scam. Nevertheless, the service was holding more than $4 million in user deposits when it went offline.GBL’s demise came on the heels of a hack into the inputs.io Bitcoin wallet, resulting in the loss of $1.2 million worth of Bitcoins.At the moment, investors or have been scammed or swindled have little legal recourse — there’s not much the FBI or some other national agency can do.Perhaps this is the nature of things in a frontier economy. The strongest companies will survive and would thus be poised to thrive at a later stage of Bitcoin’s development.Until then, investors would be wise to perform due diligence before jumping into any investments. It’s just like Las Vegas here: You should not put up anything you cannot afford to lose.",[]
"Atlantis shuts down, hindsight suggests it was a scam all along",Eric Barrier,2013-09-29 17:20:00,55,0,"After launching in June with a great deal of publicity, Silk Road competitor Atlantis sought to make buying contraband easier through cheaper prices and better security.As of mid-September, Atlantis has gone offline and now sleeps with the fishes, just like its namesake. Its users were told in an open letter that all activity will come to a halt, and everyone has a week to get his/her Bitcoins out.That’s an anticlimactic end for a black market that had both a Facebook page and a promotional video on YouTube.Daniel Cawrey at CoinDesk says that hindsight now shows Atlantis was all a big scam, anyway. Users have reported trouble getting their money out, and once the site went offline, there was no further recourse.But whatever, as far as those customers go. Anyone trying to buy coke online should assume these kinds of risk, right?The bigger problem is the publicity building up to the scam. The problem is that it vindicates a lot of Bitcoin naysayers who are currently nodding smugly to themselves.These hackers and their Monopoly money…Meanwhile, Jason King down in Pensacola is trying to raise money for his homeless outreach, Sean’s Outpost, via Bitcoin.Meanwhile, the Bitcoin Foundations is meeting with lawmakers to assure them this isn’t all a big Ponzi scheme.The Bitcoin community needs to be ready for scams of this scale and infamy, because more will follow. It’s not a discredit to the currency itself, but scamming does pollute the overall narrative, which hinders everyone’s ability to build a functioning economy.",[]
Silk Road’s Ross Ulbricht Denied Review of Prison Life Sentence by Supreme Court,Molly Jane Zuckerman,2018-06-29 12:10:17,17474,286,"The U.S. Supreme Court has denied the review of the life sentence of Ross Ulbricht, also known as the “Dread Pirate Roberts” of the Silk Road darknet marketplace, according to a court order released today, June 28.Twitter account @free_ross tweeted the news today, calling the court’s decision “devastating:”“SCOTUS denied #RossUlbricht cert petition this morning after holding it pending Carpenter.

Korea’s Kakao Corp. Considers Private Placement to Raise Funds for Blockchain Subsidiary,Molly Jane Zuckerman,2018-06-29 15:55:21,15363,239,"South Korea’s messaging app operator Kakao Corp. is considering offering a private placement to attract investors to develop their blockchain subsidiary, Bloomberg reports today, June 28.Kakao Corporation’s blockchain initiative, the Tokyo-based Ground X, was announced at the end of March as part of the messaging app operator’s new Kakao 3.0 business plan aimed at the wider Asian markets. Bloomberg writes that Ground X aims to release a test version in September, with the blockchain platform going live by the end of 2018.Jason Han, Ground X’s CEO, told Bloomberg the blockchain platform may be considering getting capital next month from collaboration with consumer-service companies used for gaming and content sharing, but added that no firm plans have been finalized.In terms of what Ground X will consist of, Han predicts the addition of services like Steemit, in this case where users are rewarded for original content with cryptocurrency. According to Han, the services that Ground X will offer will be “more practical” than what other players offer in the blockchain space:“The biggest problem with blockchain right now is that there isn’t a single service that an average person would use.”Ground X’s location in Japan was chosen due to regulatory reasons, Han said, as Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) are not legal in South Korea, where most of Korean chat app Kakao’s 50 million monthly users are based. Han notes that although Ground X and Kakao will work together, there are currently no immediate plans to put the Kakao chat app on the blockchain.Pavel Durov’s popular messaging app, Telegram, also expanded into the crypto sector this year, cancelling their plans to launch a public ICO after their two accredited investor-only pre-ICO rounds raised a combined total of $1.7 billion.Han acknowledged to Bloomberg that while it was true that creating a blockchain platform is no longer anything new, “we aren’t late here:”“We know we’re not frontrunners of blockchain technology.

South Korean Financial Watchdog Releases Stricter AML Guidelines for Virtual Currencies,Molly Jane Zuckerman,2018-06-29 10:03:02,11105,207,"South Korea’s top financial regulator has released a set of revised anti-money laundering (AML) guidelines for virtual currencies, according to a press release published this week.The press release notes that the Financial Services Commission (FSC) conducted on-site inspections of three domestic banks - Nonghyup, Kookmin, and Hana Bank - the results of which prompted the update to AML guidelines.The new guidelines note that cryptocurrency exchanges must conduct Customer Due Diligence (CDD) and Enhanced Customer Identification (EDD) to ensure the trade purposes and funding sources of users are legitimate. If a business refuses or is unable to provide information for customer verification, the guidelines note that any transactions from that entity must be rejected or terminated.According to the revised guidelines, crypto exchanges are also responsible for making certain that foreigners are not using local crypto exchanges, criminals are not using the personal accounts of other people to launder money, and that there are no suspicious transactions and payment processing, CCN news site writes.In May, the FSC joined a cryptocurrency probe already initiated by South Korea’s Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) into AML compliance with crypto exchanges.",4

The negative sentiment is keeping these new first-time investors at bay who are postponing their purchases.Blockchain venture capitalist Spencer Bogart believes that there is more pain left in the system. He expects some more selling because the hedge funds that had opened about a year ago are likely to face redemptions in near future.So, how low can the digital currencies fall? Let’s check the charts.Though Bitcoin has been trading above the $6,075 levels for the past two days, the failure of the bulls to ensure a strong bounce at this critical support shows weakness. This indicates that the buyers are still not willing to put fresh money at these levels.The bears will now attempt to break below $6,000 once again. If successful, the digital currency can slide to $5,450 and below that to $5,000.If the bulls hold the $6,000 mark, a pullback to the downtrend line is likely. The BTC/USD pair will gain strength above the 20-day EMA.The positive divergence on the RSI also points to a relief rally. However, when the sentiment is downbeat, trades should not be taken on the basis of positive divergences alone, unless price also confirms it.We suggest long positions at $6,900 with a stop below the recent lows. The target objectives on the upside are $7,700 and $8,500.This is a risky trade as our initial stop loss is large. Hence, please keep the allocation size at 40 percent of usual. We shall add to the position once we get a confirmation that a bottom is in place.Ethereum has convincingly broken below the support at $450. It can now slide to the next support level at $358.The ETH/USD pair will show signs of a change in trend if it breaks out and closes above the downtrend line and the 20-day EMA.We suggest waiting for at least two positive closes above the 20-day EMA before attempting any long positions. The resistances on the upside are at $550 and $628.Ripple is struggling to stay above the critical support level at $0.45351. A breakdown from this level can extend the fall to $0.24.Any attempt to pull back from the current levels will face a stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA, the downtrend line 1 and at $0.56270.We recommend waiting for a close above $0.56270 before initiating any long positions. The upside target is $0.70. The XRP/USD pair will pick up momentum once it breaks out of the downtrend line of the descending triangle.  Bitcoin Cash broke down and closed below the critical support at $736.0137 on June 26. It can now slide to the next support at $619.7510 if the bulls fail to defend the $683 levels.  Any attempt to pull back will face a stiff resistance at $736.0137 and at the downtrend line. A close (UTC time frame) above $800 increases the probability of a rally to $934 and above that to $1200.Historically, the 20-day EMA has proven to be a strong resistance. Hence, we shall wait until the BCH/USD pair scales above this level before recommending any long positions.We anticipate EOS to slide to the $5.9610 once it breaks below the June 24 lows of $6.8926. Currently, the bulls are attempting a pullback, which will face selling at the downtrend line 2.If the bulls succeed in sustaining above the downtrend line 2, a pullback to $10.3384 is possible.Considering the slew of overhead resistances, we shall wait for the EOS/USD pair to break out of the downtrend line before proposing any trades.The bulls have been trying to hold the $75 line for the past three days. The RSI is deeply oversold; hence, we believe that Litecoin will pull back to the downtrend line.If the bulls break out of the downtrend line and the 20-day EMA, a pullback to the $107.102 is likely.If the LTC/USD pair fails to break out of the downtrend line, the probability of a breakdown towards the next support at $67 increase.We shall wait for a new buy setup to form before proposing any bullish trades.Cardano broke down and closed (UTC time frame) below the critical support at $0.13 on June 26. If the bears sustain below $0.13 for three days in a row, it increases the probability of a decline to the next support at $0.078215.The RSI is in the oversold territory; hence, a short-term pullback can’t be ruled out. The ADA/USD pair will face a stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA.Hence, we suggest traders to wait until the price breaks out of $0.182 for initiating any long positions.The bears are keeping up the pressure on Stellar. They managed to secure a close (UTC time frame) below $0.184 on June 26, which is a negative development. This shows a lack of interest among the traders to own the digital currency even at these levels.Unless the bulls quickly force a rebound and break out of the 20-day EMA, the XLM/USD pair will break down of $0.184 and slide to the next support at $0.138. Such a move will invalidate our assumption of the formation of a large range.We shall turn bullish only after the virtual currency sustains above the 20-day EMA for a couple of days. Until then, all rallies will be sold into.IOTA is trading close to the critical support at $0.9150. The bears are capping all pullbacks close to $1.07.A break down of the $0.9150 levels can sink the IOTA/USD pair to the next support at $0.666.The first sign of strength will be when the bulls break out of the 20-day EMA and the downtrend line. We shall wait for a new buy setup to form before recommending any long positions.Tron is struggling to stay above the critical support at $0.03738021 as the bears continue to sell on every small pullback. This increases the probability of a fall to the next major support at $0.02382000.Any attempt to pull back will face resistance at the 20-day EMA and at the downtrend line. The TRX/USD pair will become positive after it breaks out of the 50-day SMA.The developing bullish divergence on the RSI is a positive sign. However, we shall wait for a new buy setup to form, before suggesting any long positions in it.The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.

"Third Largest Crypto Exchange Huobi Opens London Office, Sets OTC Trading for Q3 2018",William Suberg,2018-06-30 07:00:15,10428,337,"Chinese cryptocurrency exchange Huobi confirmed the opening of its London office June 28, with over-the-counter (OTC) trading tests set to begin in Q3 this year.In a press release shared with Cointelegraph, Huobi, which claims to have a global user base of “more that five million,” continued its recent narrative that expansion into Europe was a priority, with London a deliberate choice for basing its new operations.“London was selected as the first office in Europe, due to its preeminence as a global financial center and the largest cryptocurrency trading centre in the region with an active blockchain community and fast developing market,” the exchange wrote in praise of the local UK landscape.“Huobi’s UK growth will be supported by high quality finance and technology talent pools and an open cryptocurrency regulatory environment.”The move follows similar decisions from other major exchange industry players, most conspicuous among which is Binance, once the world’s biggest operator by volume, which moved to Malta in April.At the same time, Cointelegraph reported, Huobi set its sights on London, privileging the location above all others as its “Europe gateway.”“Not Malta, not Switzerland. Absolutely London, more precisely Britain,” Huobi Group vice president Peng Hu said.Huobi plans to offer OTC trading throughout the European market. Its new presence in London should “provide improved access to European financial markets and will enable UK-based blockchain and crypto asset startups to benefit from Huobi Labs and the Huobi Ecosystem Fund,” it added.Spearheading the operation will be Lester Li as European Exchange Director and Josh Goodbody as General Counsel and Chief Compliance Officer at Huobi UK.As of press time, Huobi is the third largest crypto exchange in the world at around $500 million in daily trade volume, according to Coinmarketcap.",[]
Almost 9 out of 10 Crypto Execs Want ‘Formalized’ Industry Self-Regulation: Research,William Suberg,2018-06-29 05:20:31,9016,207,"Eighty-six percent of cryptocurrency firms’ executives and investors want the industry to self-regulate, new research published this week reveals.Part of the 2018 Cryptocurrency Survey by international law firm Foley & Lardner LLP, the majority of respondents also tipped Bitcoin to become the cryptocurrency of choice for transactions in the long term.The firm questioned a total of 62 figures in March and April this year.“We’d rather be leading the path forward than following behind,” one executive said about the regulatory issues in the current space.“There are plenty of ways to work with regulators and legislatures to develop commonsense cryptocurrency laws and regulations.”A total of 89% of respondents saw the need for “formalized” self-regulation, with a slightly lower majority considering that these formalized standards should have regulatory oversight from authorities.In general, the issue of how to establish regulatory order in cryptocurrency formed a “concern” for survey participants (72%), who cited the “lack of legal certainty” persisting throughout many jurisdictions.In other aspects, however, opinions diverged. Looking forward, Bitcoin should come out on top as a transactional method, while Ethereum should conversely become an investment favorite, 43% and 38% of respondents claim respectively.The results came in several months before US regulators hinted that neither Bitcoin nor Ethereum constituted securities.",1
"Japan’s LINE Plans to Launch Crypto Exchange in July, Excludes Japanese, US Traders",William Suberg,2018-06-28 21:05:23,10044,194,"Japanese social messaging app LINE will launch a cryptocurrency exchange for 30 coins next month, it revealed Thursday, June 28.In a press release, the company, which counts around 200 million monthly users, confirmed it would offer crypto-to-crypto trading platform BITBOX “globally” excluding the U.S. and Japan.“With the need to trade cryptocurrencies rising around the world, LINE has been preparing to provide opportunities for users to do so securely, and as the secure system is in place now, the company will be offering the service,” the release states.As Cointelegraph reported in January, LINE had been in talks with Japanese regulators over launching an exchange. The decision to exclude Japan from BITBOX, which will not handle fiat currency, now appears tied to regulatory difficulties.“LINE will engage in the cryptocurrency business in compliance with rules and regulations of respective countries on cryptocurrency trading,” it added.Japan’s cryptocurrency exchange sector continues to face major upheaval. Last week, regulators issued so-called ‘Business Improvement Orders’ to six operators. The Financial Services Agency’s attempt to make the industry legally watertight and prevent security lapses took place in the wake of the January $530 million hack of Coincheck.Other major names have meanwhile committed to Japan’s domestic exchange market, these including SBI Group and, from 2019, Yahoo!",[]
EOS CTO Proposes Rehauling Constitution as Disputes Over Governance Continue,Marie Huillet,2018-06-28 09:05:21,13859,212,"Chief Technical Officer (CTO) of blockchain protocol EOS Dan Larimer has proposed rehauling the project’s existing constitution to limit so-called arbitrators’ powers, in an EOSGov Telegram chat today, June 27.Larimer’s proposal comes in response to recent controversies surrounding the structure of governance on the EOS blockchain, in which three distinct groups work to ‘keep one another in check,’ as defined by the project’s current constitution.These three groups in the EOS ecosystem are the so-called Block Producers (BPs) – the equivalent of miners on the Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain – the arbitrators (EOS Core Arbitration Forum (ECAF)) and Token-Holders.The ECAF in particular has drawn criticism over the reportedly opaque nature of its role and powers, thrown into relief by a series of mishaps that have occurred since the EOS mainnet first went live June 15.In the recent Telegram discussion, Larimer argued that “forcing people into an unknown arbitration system for undefined reasons is a fast way to cause people to run.He proposed that arbitrators’ role should be limited to cases where there is a “strong foundation with very clear and defined failure points that can be arbitrated” – in his opinion, only where there is a “code - intent mismatch.”June’s arbitration mishaps have caused an outcry from prominent crypto industry members, including Charlie Shrem and Nick Szabo.One recent incident saw the Block Producers reportedly receive an emergency ECAF order to refuse to process transactions for 27 accounts – “pending further review of the claims by an Arbitrator,” with the “logic and reasoning” for the order to be posted at a later date.On June 24, EOS BP New York said it could not “with confidence execute any subsequent statements claiming to be a valid ECAF opinion,” after a further – apparently fake – ECAF order had been issued.As Dogecoin creator, Jackson Palmer, remarked on Twitter yesterday, Larimer is effectively today suggesting to “scrap[...] the entire [EOS] ‘constitution’ and start[...] over.”Crypto persona WhalePanda said the proposal was basically “a similar governance model like $ETH where the foundation bails out big losses/hacks/DAO-ish events... but more centralized.”Since going live this month, the EOS network has faced technical issues, on top of the furore over arbitration matters.EOS is currently the fifth largest cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap, with a market cap of $7.2 bln. The coin has seen an over 4 percent growth over the past 24 hours to press time, trading at $8.07.",11
Exclusive: Binance Set to Launch Its First Crypto-Fiat Exchange in Uganda,Marie Huillet,2018-06-29 12:40:17,24026,1553,"Changpeng Zhao, the CEO and founder of Binance, said the company is about to launch a crypto-fiat exchange in Uganda, in an exclusive interview with Cointelegraph today, June 28.The new platform, Binance Uganda, will be the company’s first foray into fiat-crypto trading - supporting the Ugandan Shilling, alongside major cryptocurrencies - and is set to launch imminently.Zhao, better known in the crypto industry as ‘CZ,’ told Cointelegraph that the move “shows Binance is not just into chasing the most developed markets”:“We think that crypto has a very strong use case in less developed countries… there’s more money to be made in a more developed country, but we want to distribute crypto to the rest of the world.”Highlighting that Binance is interested in expanding to Africa’s market “in general,” CZ said work on the Uganda venture has been “progressing really fast,” thanks to strong support from government, regulators and the industry:“Uganda [is a] really interesting situation, only 11 percent of the population has bank accounts. It’s both a challenge and an opportunity. So it may be easier to adopt cryptocurrency as a form of currency instead of trying to push for bank adoption. It’s an interesting experiment - Africa’s a big market, that’s why we’re there.”Given that this will be “the first time Binance has touched fiat,” the exchange will have a lot of know your customer and anti money laundering (KYC/AML) regulatory questions to figure out, the CEO stressed, before it can scale further.Binance Uganda will be an independent structure, but with “strong business corporation” with the existing platform. From a systems perspective, it will be a separate - but identical - installation of Binance’s existing code base, with the same operations, security and system.  CZ appeared unfazed by the falling trade volumes - both on Binance and other crypto exchanges - through 2018, noting that “markets always overreact” - both when things are going well, and when things cool off - and that he’s “seen this many times, five or six times on a yearly cycle.”He considers that volatility will ultimately settle when the total market cap of the industry will increase, and suggested that opening more fiat channels - as in the new Uganda venture - can help promote more growth.To prepare for “the next uptick,” Binance is improving its systems to allow for more volume - 100 or 1000 times more than it supports at present. “I don’t know when it’s going to happen, but we’ve got to be ready for it.”The company is also set to launch in 2 or 3 more locations in the short term and continues to work on a prototype for its decentralized exchange.Binance is currently one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges by daily trade volumes, seeing $789 million in trades in the 24 hours to press time, according to Coinmarketcap.The full interview with Changpeng Zhao will soon be available on Cointelegraph’s YouTube channel.",1
"FBI Has 130 Ongoing Crypto Cases, a ‘Small Sliver’ of All Investigations, Agent Says",Marie Huillet,2018-06-29 11:55:15,12925,196,"FBI agent Kyle Armstrong said the Bureau has 130 ongoing crypto-related cases, with dark web drug sales a particular concern, Bloomberg reported Wednesday, June 27.Speaking at the Crypto Evolved conference in New York on Wednesday, the supervisory special agent said the number represented “a small sliver,” of the FBI’s activities, which number “thousands of cases.” The agency has nonetheless noticed an increase in illegal activity facilitated by cryptocurrency payments, he said.The 130 “threat tagged” files related to crypto span a gamut of crimes, including human trafficking, kidnapping, ransomware attacks and illicit drug sales.This latter has become a focus for the Bureau, according to Armstrong, highlighting the opioid epidemic in the U.S. He considered the dark web to be a factor in enabling drug abuse, saying that 10 percent of global drug users make their purchases on illegal online marketplaces.Armstrong’s figure of 10 percent is notably not higher than statistics released by an older Global Drug Survey from 2017, which found the global median for the percentage of drug users who use the darknet to be 10.1 percent. 90 percent then, continue to purchase illicit substances via more ‘traditional’ methods.Armstrong, who manages the three-year-old Virtual Currency Initiative for the FBI as it relates to money laundering activities, said that while the underlying blockchain technology makes it easier for investigators to trace cryptocurrencies than cash, the relative anonymity of transactions can prove an obstacle.In February, a two-year study of the dark web ecosystem claimed that Bitcoin may in fact be losing its cachet as the most popular currency on dark web markets, seemingly due to consumers’ annoyance at network traffic and high transaction fees.",2
Crypto Exchange Bithumb Reduces Hack Loss Estimation From $31 Mln to $17 Mln,Molly Jane Zuckerman,2018-06-29 08:09:56,11185,272,"Hacked South Korea crypto exchange Bithumb has lowered the estimated amount of money lost in the hack from 35 billion won (about $31 million) to 19 billion won (about $17 million), according to a support announcement Thursday, June 28.Bithumb first reported the hack on June 20, temporarily suspending all deposits and withdrawals. The South Korean Ministry of Science and Technology has since launched a probe into the causes behind the hack.Bithumb writes today that the “main reason” for lowering the loss estimation to $17 million is the “ongoing participation, support, and cooperation of the cryptocurrency exchanges and cryptocurrencies foundations across the world,” also noting their removal of their crypto holdings from a hot wallet to a cold wallet as helping stem the damage.Today’s announcement lays out the 11 cryptocurrencies that were stolen, with 2,016 Bitcoin (BTC) taken, worth about $12.3 million by press time, and 2,219 Ethereum (ETH) taken, worth about $965,000 by press time.Bithumb hack damage report (total value shown in won). Source: official announcementBithumb still asks users to refrain from making any deposits until a further announcement is released.Crypto exchanges have reacted differently to hacks, with some situations, like Bithumb, resulting in a promise to reimburse all customers affected, and others, like BitGrail, leading to legal battles and a seizure of the firm’s wallets.",[]
